## General

- Setup wasn't too hard for a simple one-off project like _Crafting Interpreters_. I know I have a bit to do to recall all the nitty-gritty.
- Mac has _clank_ which is the C complier. _gcc_ is also available, as usual.
  - There's a _clank-tidy_ and _clank-format_ that I need to learn more about.
- Having flashbacks of how complex `Makefile` files can be. Need to review more.

## Headers

- To access from .c files, need relative or absolute paths; still haven't learned a project way of doing this like TS or Rust.

## Source Code

```c
static int simpleInstruction(const char *name, int offset)
// ⬆️ static function can only be accessed from within the file.
```
