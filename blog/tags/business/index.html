The other person can do all of the work,&quot; you think. Not so fast, Slick. You&#x27;ve gotta shoulder some of that responsibility. If you want your pitch, your presentation, your partner to be successful, you have to participate as well. </p><p>While being alone on stage imparts focus and attention from the audience more so than multiple would, having a pair of people on stage can be highly effective in getting your point across. But it only works well if you back each other up. Having another person on stage doing essentially nothing is a distraction. Don&#x27;t be the distraction!</p><p>One key to success in business is collaboration. This is especially true on the stage, when you and a partner are working together to present. Presenting as a pair is not much different than presenting alone; all of the same components apply:</p><ul><li>Write, Rehearse and Repeat. Together. Practicing together is essential.</li><li>You still need Logos, Pathos, and Ethos to make the speech work. Having two people on stage doesn&#x27;t make you more credible; it just means you have twice the opportunity to prove yourselves</li><li>Body language and timing become more important than ever before; you have to be able to hand off topics in way that is clear to the audience. An improper segue can lose you audience&#x27;s attention very easily.</li></ul><p>Partnering with someone on a presentation can be very gratifying. You get to share your ideas with another person who is aligned with you and you also can get a different take on your shared topic. It can make getting on stage a little less anxiety inducing for many people, but that does not mean you can simply delegate all the effort onto to the other person.</p><p>Partnerships take practice, but double the potential.</p><p> </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>An entry on the more corporate/legal side of partnerships: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership</a></li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/speaking">speaking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/speaking/the-overlap-of-past-present-and-future-personalities">The Overlap of Past, Present and Future Personalities</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-04-04T08:49:28.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 4, 2019</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4eec2622d18594aea04310ae3ec577c" alt="Adam Kecskes"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Adam Kecskes</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Organizational and Operational Optimizer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In a conversation with a successful entrepreneur buddy of mine, he offered an interesting (to me) perspective to take with regards to making forward motion your life. His premise is that most people tend to look for work that &quot;suits their current needs or personalities.&quot; This is wrong, according to my friend. Rather, a person should adapt his or her ideas looking for a job that will suit their future needs.</p><p>This isn&#x27;t a particularly new idea; Dan Gilbert talks about it in his book &quot;Stumbling on Happiness&quot; (which I have not read, but have seen his TED talk that has similar content). What I think I like about my friend&#x27;s perspective is that it&#x27;s just skewed enough away from my current thinking that it got me thinking more.</p><p>If we stick with the &quot;looking for a job based on current personality,&quot; what we&#x27;re really doing is anchoring ourselves to our past personality â you know, the one that would rather binge watch TV than writing the next great screenplay? â and in doing so, we&#x27;re limiting ourselves. What we should do instead is project our personality from the present into the future, and ask something like, &quot;What would my personality need to be like in order to succeed at this particular job?&quot; and &quot;How do I adapt from where I am to where I would like to be?&quot;</p><p>I think what really stands out about my friend&#x27;s perspective is much more basic than the philosophy and psychology of happiness. Rather, it&#x27;s a reminder that simply talking to other people with an open mind and an ear towards listening can offer new, even if tiny insights. And each insight is a stepping stone into the future, rather than reflection of the past. </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/18/daniel-gilbert-happiness-future-self/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/18/daniel-gilbert-happiness-future-self/</a></li><li>https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400077427</li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/reviews">reviews</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/speaking/suit-up-consistently-for-team-pitches">Suit Up (Consistently) for Team Pitches</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-04-03T19:36:10.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 3, 2019</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4eec2622d18594aea04310ae3ec577c" alt="Adam Kecskes"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Adam Kecskes</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Organizational and Operational Optimizer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Overheard at a coffee shop, regarding a final presentation for a college communications class:</p><blockquote>&quot;Three of us were accountants, but the fourth was a geo-engineer. We all wore business casual, but he wore sneakers and a t-shirt and a backwards baseball cap that he <em>refused to take off </em>[emphasis from speaker].&quot;</blockquote><p>Wow. It&#x27;s not so much that they disagreed on the mode of dress; what makes this a bad situation is that the forth fellow refused to even accommodate for the situation.

If they can&#x27;t manage to act like a team during a pitch, how much of a team will they be when the business ramps up to full speed?</p><p>Take a moment to reflect on past team experiences â heck, even personal experiences. Have you let your attitude get in the way? Have you let a minor stubborn tick lead you to go against the grain of the moment? Yes, going against the grain is the way to go when you&#x27;re committed and have a fantastic idea to pitch to the world, but refusing to remove your hat to support the rest of the team&#x27;s pitch? That&#x27;s just unreasonable.</p><p>Suit up, hat off â if that&#x27;s what is going to win the pitch.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital</li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/speaking">speaking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/speaking/connectedness-is-effectiveness">Connectedness is Effectiveness</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-03-29T09:29:51.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 29, 2019</time> Â· <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4eec2622d18594aea04310ae3ec577c" alt="Adam Kecskes"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Adam Kecskes</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Organizational and Operational Optimizer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Less about about public speaking, more about being connected with your fellow human being â which, really you should be shooting for when you&#x27;re giving a presentation or speech anyway.

Don&#x27;t underestimate it. And seriously, don&#x27;t take yourself too seriously.</p><p>The first meetings I had with external vendors was nerve-wracking. Whether it be in person or over the phone, I wanted to impress, to not slip up, and to look good.</p><p>Humor was out of the question, right? For me, yes.</p><p>When I eventually took on a technical training/sales engineer role, I had to go out and speak to anywhere from twenty to a hundred people at a time. Sweaty palms all day, every day. But the effort taught me something. Humor is okay. In fact, humor in business is awesome.</p><p>I&#x27;ve always been one of those people (not uncommon) who tries to break up tense situations with a joke or a funny aside here and there. It took awhile, but during my trainings I realized two things: 1) Being humorous relaxed me (if only a tiny bit) and 2) the audience seemed to be more engaged and retain more information (if my end-of-training polls were to be believed). So I kept it up. Those first few years of being in the &quot;corporate public,&quot; as it were, did a lot to improve my confidence.</p><p>But a place that took me much longer to gain confidence in was meetings. Face-to-face, we&#x27;ve-got-business-to-discuss type meetings. Large accounts, small accounts, vendors, clients, customers, internal, external. Nerve-f&#x27;n&#x27;-wracking.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t know my stuff. I was just fearful and confident that my confidence would show through. Ground zero of imposter syndrome. </p><p>But I watched. I listened. I recalled how humor helped me in presentations. I started to apply it here and there. And I started to mimic, a little, with my own style, people who I respected who seemed to be able to inject humor at anytime, even when the situation was dark.</p><p>Take Ben, a sysadmin who I admired greatly. Gregarious, smart, open-minded and caring. We&#x27;d often be on phone meetings together, and he&#x27;d slip in the funniest little things. A self deprecating joke here. A ironic observation there. He&#x27;d ask about people&#x27;s family (which isn&#x27;t funny, per se, but he&#x27;d often open up a meeting with a funny story about his own family, then crack a joke about his wife painted his toenails for him so she could relax). Over time, what I came to realize was that being open and humorous was okay. </p><p>Business is business, but humans are humans, and good rapport trumps all challenges. Rapport created through openness, listening, and humor.</p><p>It took more formal training and research into public speaking to move beyond the silly jokes and ad libs I&#x27;d put into my earliest training presentations. It took listening to people like Ben and how folks responded to me to be okay with experimenting to move beyond my massive shyness and overly serious nature (in the business world). The combination of the two, public speaking training and observation, for me learn how to be more comfortable in my own skin, more comfortable with other people (even in serious situations) and to express myself in a positive way that created connectedness, and through connectedness, effectiveness.</p><p>The moral of this story is clear: Humor has a place in meetings. Humor is a human activity. Humor is fun, even when business is serious. </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour</li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/speaking">speaking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/speaking/how-meetings-can-ruin-your-credibility">How Meetings Can Ruin Your Credibility</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-03-26T09:23:19.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 26, 2019</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4eec2622d18594aea04310ae3ec577c" alt="Adam Kecskes"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://kecskes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Adam Kecskes</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Organizational and Operational Optimizer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Have you been asked to setup a meeting?

It&#x27;s not the 19th or 20th century anymore. You can impress your boss in far better ways â like by holding fewer meetings.

Today, I encountered a LinkedIn article and an NPR radio program that centered around the idea of toxic leadership, so it seemed like an obvious choice for a topic, especially considering how many toxic leaders I&#x27;ve encountered in my own career.</p><p>My mother, of all people, use to always say &quot;Screw up, move up.&quot; I remember her saying that about politicians when I was a kid and she still says it today. Why is that?</p><p>Part it is what is known as the Peter Principle.</p><p> Dr. Laurence Peter, for whom the principle is named put it this way:</p><blockquote class="inlinequote"><p>In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.</p></blockquote><p>However, that&#x27;s only part of the problem. Yes, employees rise to fill bigger and bigger positions that they eventually can&#x27;t handle, but there are two other factors (among many) I&#x27;d highlight:</p><ul><li>People don&#x27;t know how to hire other people.</li><li>Over-confidence in an interview does not competence make.</li></ul><p>On the first point, hiring manager often want someone that is either like them or fulfills some arbitrary standards (from HR, from their own experience, from where ever). I&#x27;ve been involved in the (horrific) practice of group interviews, and I&#x27;ve stood aghast at some of the reasons my fellow interviewers would [not] hire someone. &quot;I was a better coder at his age!&quot; (said an older gentleman), or &quot;I still don&#x27;t like that he doesn&#x27;t have a degree&quot; (despite the fact that the candidate demonstrated phenomenal skills in the interview.)</p><p>Hiring managers/teams often forget why they are hiring someone, as well: To fulfill a particular role. But is that role even well defined? I had one boss who insisted I hire someone because he thought my team needed the help. I resisted, because I didn&#x27;t see a pressing need for anyone in the next several months.</p><p>On the second point, just because someone <em>seems </em>to be well-qualified and has a great personality in the interview doesn&#x27;t mean he or she is actually competent. In one company, my team met with a recently-hired fellow from another department; he&#x27;d been hired as a manager. He had an impressive interview â mostly in finance and Wall Street, which set off warning bells in my head, considering that wasn&#x27;t related to our business domain.</p><p>Turns out, along with the very nice interview skills and well-heeled resume, he had a nasty, nasty temper, and over-engineered certain systems so that using said systems was labyrinthian. Eventually, his team mutinied against him and the company was forced to let him go.</p><p>So what does a hiring manager do? More due diligence, for one. Call the person&#x27;s past employers (or at least have HR do it!). Set up concrete credentials to be met for the role â and I&#x27;m not talking &quot;must have 2 years of experience in such-and-such esoteric systems.&quot; Rather, codify your department&#x27;s own culture. What type of person would fit best? Remember, people have different personalities in the work environment than at home. Just because a person is shy and you&#x27;re group is outgoing, generally, doesn&#x27;t mean that person won&#x27;t fit. Consider also, what&#x27;s <em>tangentially missing</em> from the group and what would be <em>nice to have</em>. </p><p>During the interview sessions, have a consistent set of questions that don&#x27;t have pre-determined answers (well, mostly not), that way you can compare oranges to oranges. Make sure to ask interested questions, rather than interesting questions (&quot;What do you like to see in management?&quot; vs &quot;What can you do for me?&quot;) It helps to through in the biggie questions â set up a tough (and hopefully real from the past) scenario and see how they might manage their way through it. </p><p>It takes some fine tuning of other people&#x27;s tonality, body language and micro-expressions, as well as a bit of experience to hire good folks while remaining relatively unbiased. It takes a lot more work to get rid of those toxic employees (and especially) leaders that you let slip through the cracks just because they were personable in a handful of discussions.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ceos-must-tackle-toxic-senior-leaders-who-damaging-firm-hugh-shields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ceos-must-tackle-toxic-senior-leaders-who-damaging-firm-hugh-shields/</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle</a></li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/speaking">speaking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/business">business</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hiring">hiring</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Light Reading</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Tech &amp; PM Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/adamkecskes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">LinkedIn<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/adamk72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/13907148/adam-kecskes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/akecskes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 Adam Kecskes Consulting</div></div></div></footer></div>
