            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This document highlights how I work and manage teams and projects. I wrote this originally a few years ago for teams whose members were new to each other; these suggestions acted as a guide to understanding my perspectives. I know that everyone has different points of view on how to run a project. By making myself the locus of attention, they could debate with me about the details and we could come to a consensus that worked for everyone.</p><p>‚Äî<!-- --> Adam Kecskes</p><h1>The TL;DR</h1><ul><li>My style: "Continuous and automatic communication."</li><li>My style addendum: "We don't blame, we solve."</li><li>Comm priorities: @mention people rather than in general Slack (or other instant messaging); use general Slack rather than email; email only for formal occasions.</li><li>Tasks are smart objects ‚Äî describe, organize, link, attach, comment, add details as needed. Create meaningful context for others. Empty tasks are unloved tasks.</li><li>Keep transparency going by taking your thoughts out of your head and putting them into tasks, comments, and documentation. Then, @ specific people or everyone as needed.</li><li>Communicate early and often, perfect later. Plan the work; work the plan.</li><li>I'd rather know your concerns sooner rather than later.</li><li>Be secure, be safe, work smart, eat a banana üçå or an apple üçè on occasion.</li></ul><h1>The Quick</h1><p>I have a particular way of managing projects that has served me well with past clients, both small and large. This is an attempt to summarize. For more details, go to the section below titled "The Long."</p><p>The essence of my style is: "continuous and automatic communication." This is a team effort. For me to be the single source of communication between clients, contractors, and employees would be mind-numbing (and I have seen plenty a PM go crazy trying to be that person).</p><p>How I do this is usually through so-called "work-management" tools like Jira, Monday, and ClickUp. I leverage three aspects:</p><ul><li>"@"-ing people</li><li>Smart tasks</li><li>Links</li></ul><p>These aspects assume that the team is responsible and willing to follow up promptly. It does not mean "instantaneous" communication. This system is <strong>inherently asynchronous</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-ing-people">"@"-ing people<a href="#-ing-people" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;@&quot;-ing people" title="Direct link to &quot;@&quot;-ing people">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Have a question that pertains to a specific task? Don't Slack/Discord/Email ‚Äî rather, @ the person that needs to be queried. Were you the target? Answer inside of the related task or thread. In doing so, both of you maintain context for other people who touch that task in the future.</p><blockquote><p>Corollary: If needed, re-assign the task to the appropriate person. If it's not your job, it's not your job; that's okay. But don't abandon the task. Make sure someone takes care of it.</p></blockquote><p>What is the difference between communication styles?
Slack and Discord (or phone and video calls) are useful for airing out your thoughts and concerns ‚Äî dynamic communication.</p><p>@s, on the other hand, are useful for getting people's attention without intruding on their workflow, plus adding to the context of the issue for others to see.</p><p>Email is just right out. We will only be using it for formal communications, and not for day-to-day efforts. I've shared my thoughts on email on LinkedIn, so I'm not going to share them here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/e-mail-killing-your-business-adam-kecskes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/e-mail-killing-your-business-adam-kecskes/</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-tasks">Smart tasks<a href="#smart-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart tasks" title="Direct link to Smart tasks">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Tasks are not simply to-do list items. They are objects that have context and details. It is critical that developers and stakeholders alike add details that are appropriate and meaningful. Not perfect, but sufficient.</p><p>Add attachments, make comments, create checklists, and link, link, link. Do not be afraid to create another task if necessary. The whole purpose is to get details out of our heads and into the system for everyone to see.</p><blockquote><p>An empty task is an unloved task (and not helpful to you or your teammates)</p></blockquote><p>If you are a developer keep these ideas in mind: Tasks are objects with specialized callback (communication) methods. You need to provide a data payload to make it work.</p><p>And always follow the Git axiom of:</p><blockquote><p>Commit early and often, perfect later, publish once.</p></blockquote><p>The same philosophy applies here as well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="links">Links<a href="#links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Links" title="Direct link to Links">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Links create context. Links improve findability. Links boost connectivity. Links help others help you.</p><p>You may have noticed I talk a lot about context. What will make our work easier is providing context so that other people can read, assimilate, question, and eventually understand. Sometimes that is best-done face-to-face, over a call, or on Slack (but not in email; never in email!). Quite often, context is created by the links you add to a task or document.</p><p>Link so other people can learn your thought process and the events that led to the situation you are in where you may need aid ‚Äî and this helps doubly so in the case where you need to pass the task onto someone else. Either way, you're either making your job easier for yourself or someone else's job easier. Both are better states than working too hard, falling behind, and being (overly-)stressed. Link away!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bonus-transparency">Bonus: Transparency<a href="#bonus-transparency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bonus: Transparency" title="Direct link to Bonus: Transparency">‚Äã</a></h2><p>While I keep security top of mind, transparency is as important and is not a conflicting ideology. In fact, I look at transparency as being complementary to security.</p><p>Transparency does not mean sharing willy-nilly with the world. At a project level, it means keeping everyone up-to-date and at a personal level, it means taking responsibility for your actions.</p><p>How do we share? How do we keep informed? We share by @-ing people, or by adding them as the watcher of the task. We keep informed by proactively being interested in tasks or epics that are of particular interest that day or week, and becoming watchers.</p><p>Nothing should be hidden, except for particularly sensitive IP (of which you should know about in advance if you have access at all).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-and-automatic">Continuous and Automatic<a href="#continuous-and-automatic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous and Automatic" title="Direct link to Continuous and Automatic">‚Äã</a></h3><p>To summarize, the system is continuous because as a team, we will be reacting as needed to task-level communications, informed by our use of smart tasks, @-ing people and Slack. It's automatic because the tool keeps our context for us in one place and calls out to interested parties (from the individual to the whole team).</p><p>(Honestly, "habitual" is probably a better word than automatic. You tell me.)</p><h1>The Long</h1><p>Made you look. üòÜ There is a LOT more to be said about project management best practices. However, we have a project to run and you only have so much time to read.
One major point to make: This does not work if people don't participate and work as a team. Sounds almost cliche, but it's true:</p><blockquote><p>We build bigger and better when we're together than when we're alone.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve written this document because, over the past few years, I have encountered one too many situations with developers not living up to their own expectations.</p><p>As a developer myself with a couple of decades of experience under my belt, I‚Äôve seen a lot of examples of how code can go wrong and how painful it can be to fix them when the PM comes along with a new feature request or important bug fix. As a project manager I‚Äôve had to deal with the consequences of those poor coding decisions, spending an inordinate amount of time and social and political capital trying to smooth things over when a client gets upset because we went over time and budget.</p><p>You can read this as a Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zk_1ZYAQmJP4XaTYYlvV8LS4hwGvyv2C96C_Vs7wD7c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="too-much-lost-time">Too much lost time<a href="#too-much-lost-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Too much lost time" title="Direct link to Too much lost time">‚Äã</a></h3><p>And why do a lot of projects go over time and budget? Because, inevitably, as I have found, the software was written at a junior level, despite claims by those same developers as being ‚Äúsenior‚Äù or ‚Äústrong intermediate‚Äù or whatever title gives them a boost to their ego or salary.</p><p>Can you tell I‚Äôve done all that? Point is, you‚Äôre probably not as senior (or even intermediate) as you think and the way you write code and interact with the project is a risk factor I‚Äôd like to greatly reduce.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-the-real-seniors">To the real seniors<a href="#to-the-real-seniors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to To the real seniors" title="Direct link to To the real seniors">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you truly are ‚Äúsenior‚Äù (which is a term I don‚Äôt like to use, since it‚Äôs bloated and ill-defined‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say high-performing contributors instead), then you‚Äôll understand these problems. Hopefully, your team doesn‚Äôt have these sorts of issues because they can rely on you to be their local mentor, improving their output under your careful watch.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keeping-it-simple">Keeping it simple<a href="#keeping-it-simple" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Keeping it simple" title="Direct link to Keeping it simple">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I‚Äôm not going over the nitty-gritty here. This document is about raising awareness of how I like to interact with developers. I would like to start with one definition that I expect everyone I work with to follow:</p><blockquote><p><strong>pro¬∑‚Äãfes¬∑‚Äãsion¬∑‚Äãal</strong><br>
<em>adjective</em><br>
Behavior that exhibits the qualities of being trained or technically skilled; having the characteristic of being aware of the contextual backdrop as well as immediate and future needs of people, places, and systems and exhibiting courteousness, conscientiousness, and consistency in serving those needs.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, with that out of the way, let‚Äôs start with the easy thing, getting communications right:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communications">Communications<a href="#communications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communications" title="Direct link to Communications">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li>I‚Äôd rather know about your concerns earlier, rather than later. If you‚Äôre over your head, feel free to let me or the dev lead know what‚Äôs up.</li><li>In Slack (or whatever instant messaging tool we‚Äôre using), keep topics in the same thread, not in the different channels (way more on the topic of using IM <a href="https://kecskes.net/Truly%20Professional%20Instant%20Messaging%20(with%20Slack!).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li><li>Tasks, issues, tickets ‚Äî whatever we call them ‚Äî aren‚Äôt sourced in the IM tool; they‚Äôre sourced in the PM tool (Jira, Monday, etc. ). So, don‚Äôt update the status in the IM, update them in the PM tool. Less IM‚Äôing, more updating tasks.</li><li>Minimize your DMs to me or anyone else. If you have a question, regardless of how awkward you think it might be to ask, ask it to the development public channel. We‚Äôre here to help you, not chastise you (and believe me, I‚Äôve made plenty of dumb mistakes in my time).</li><li>If you‚Äôre in front of the client or customer for any reason, always err on the side of caution. Don‚Äôt spout out something unless you‚Äôve gotten previous approval from me or the lead (and that can occur if I or the lead are leading the conversation by example).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-development">Software Development<a href="#software-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Development" title="Direct link to Software Development">‚Äã</a></h2><p> This section will generate a lot of debate, even from the high performers. The essence of what I‚Äôm going to share boils down to two points:</p><ul><li>Any code should be easy to read and easy to change for other developers on the team, not just yourself.</li><li>The client will change their mind. This is inevitable and can occur at any time. The code has to support this point by being fast to set up, reasonably flexible, easily configurable, nominally updatable, and ready to demonstrate at any time.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="basics">Basics<a href="#basics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Basics" title="Direct link to Basics">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Code should be DRY. This literally has been the biggest cause of most of my projects‚Äô problems over the past few years.<ul><li>Don‚Äôt copy and paste code; if you had to write it twice, there‚Äôs a decent chance you‚Äôll have to write it a third time‚Ä¶ or more.</li><li>Get out of the habit of copy-and-pasting because it‚Äôs a crutch; you need to think outside the file.</li><li>At some point in a project, you‚Äôll spend more time hunting down errors in your cascading load of copy-and-paste, non-DRY code than you will writing new features or quickly fixing bugs. Just remove that risk entirely.</li><li>I go over the deeper consequences in this long-form document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBTcmixSCl099-lpDCkitNlcGk8K0uFoNtgnhLPE4-Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Curse of Copy-and-Paste Code</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Don‚Äôt ignore the details of the design document.<ul><li>It doesn‚Äôt have to be pixel-perfect, but it has to be very close.</li><li>UI devs: Figma and other similar tools give you the CSS code, so use it.</li></ul></li><li>No warnings or errors for lint, the browser, interpreter, or compiler before committing/merging (without explanation).</li><li>Use a code spelling check extension. You‚Äôll avoid a ton of basic mistakes and improve your debugging because you won‚Äôt miss that one misspelled variable. </li><li>No hard coded, ‚Äúmagic‚Äù values.<ul><li>Pull client/customer text out of the code and add it as a part of an I18N file, even if it‚Äôs only for a single language.</li><li>Create config files for things like maximums, minimums, colors, and other things that the client might change their mind on.</li><li>Don‚Äôt make these (or any) files monolithic.</li></ul></li><li>Files less than 200 lines (without a good reason for going higher).</li><li>CSS is a programming language; treat it as such.</li><li>Idiomatic code is preferred; if you don‚Äôt know a language‚Äôs idioms, learn them.</li><li>No zombie code; no commented-out code. If you‚Äôre not using it, don‚Äôt crowd the file by leaving it in.</li><li>More files and folders are better than a single long file.</li><li>Standardize formatting; use Prettier (or the formatter of the team‚Äôs choice).</li><li>Keep <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOLID</a> and <a href="https://dannorth.net/2022/02/10/cupid-for-joyful-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUPID</a> design principles in mind when developing.</li><li>Be consistent in how you name things. Follow your team‚Äôs general lead if you‚Äôre not sure.</li><li>Be wary of deeply nested files or long files (usually the two are the same). Break files up into reusable component parts.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intermediate">Intermediate<a href="#intermediate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Intermediate" title="Direct link to Intermediate">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Double-check the data. This is the second most painful point that I keep encountering on projects, where there‚Äôs been a typo or a missed change in a data structure or the data itself.</li><li>Actually be as detail-oriented as you claim on your resume; look at the rest of the code and understand the impact of your code changes on the rest of the code, your teammates, and how it will show up to the client. </li><li>Learn how to think in abstractions rather than in literals, i.e., figure out how to use generics if the language supports them.</li><li>Even if you don‚Äôt write tests, at least think about how you would test your code, were you to write test code.</li><li>Follow the practice of limiting your deeply nested <code>if</code> statements. Switches are just fancy <code>if</code> statements, so consider why you‚Äôre using them before you do. Likely there‚Äôs a more functional way or a specific code pattern that will do the trick better.</li><li>Lots of <code>if</code> statement code does not a good state machine make; use a proper library.</li><li>Learn your frameworks, tools, libraries, and packages. Leverage all of the amazing work other smart people have already done so you don‚Äôt have to do the work yourself.</li><li>Type your code, e.g., use TypeScript and not JavaScript. I know types can be annoying, but they will save you a ton of time in the long run.</li><li>For TypeScript in particular:<ul><li>Don‚Äôt use the <code>any</code> type. Do everything you can to avoid it.</li><li>Learn how to use interfaces, types, unions, intersections, and type narrowing. The rest will follow.</li></ul></li><li>Don‚Äôt overuse the <code>?</code> operator. Understand your data, rather than relying on the code as a catch-all for your ignorance.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advanced">Advanced<a href="#advanced" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advanced" title="Direct link to Advanced">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Learn good programming design patterns; there are a ton, but Proxy, Provider, Observer, and Factory are some good examples. Always be looking for patterns.</li><li>If you‚Äôve been doing procedural programming for a long time, learn functional programming. Most modern languages are multi-modal so you can practice any number of programming paradigms.</li><li>Avoid setting things to <code>null</code>. Study Rust for the how, and look up the ‚Äúbillion dollar mistake‚Äù for why.</li><li>Learn to use <code>git</code> for more than just committing, pulling, and pushing. It‚Äôs super-useful as a development tool in its own right. But for <code>git</code> usage in general:</li><li>Be conscientious of your commit messages; other people read them.</li><li>Commit small, commit often.</li><li>Set your CI/CD systems up so that issues are auto-closed when the merge happens so you don‚Äôt have to remember to do it manually. It saves everyone a lot of time not asking, ‚ÄúHey, did you really get to this?‚Äù </li><li>There‚Äôs way more I could write on this topic; but other, better, developers have already done so. Go out and read books and Internet articles on coding best practices and then implement those practices. Teach others while you‚Äôre at it. Experiment ‚Äî Even feel free to experiment with new ideas in an ongoing project. As long as it‚Äôs vetted by the team or the wider development community, it‚Äôs probably better than the overly rudimentary copy-and-post code you‚Äôve been doing.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-expectations">Final Expectations<a href="#final-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final Expectations" title="Direct link to Final Expectations">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Ultimately, regardless of your programming skill level, what I expect from developers is professionalism. No coder does development in true isolation; if you‚Äôre on a paid project, you need to step up and make coding a profession, not a hobby. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="juniors">Juniors<a href="#juniors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Juniors" title="Direct link to Juniors">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I expect junior developers to be constantly communicating their small accomplishments. I expect them to write trivial code; I expect them to be learning all the time. But I (or the dev lead) want to hear about what is being learned, almost daily.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contributors">Contributors<a href="#contributors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contributors" title="Direct link to Contributors">‚Äã</a></h3><p>For higher-performing contributors, I expect a high degree of autonomy, lateral thinking, and a holistic approach to development; that is, you don‚Äôt have to think outside of the box, but you do have to think outside of the file. You should be making systems that make everyone‚Äôs life easier. Ideally, you have these systems ready to go at the start of the project.</p><p>I also expect nearly daily updates, especially inside the task you‚Äôre working on. You and I don‚Äôt even have to talk about anything as long as I see that tasks are legitimately being updated with useful commentary and details. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="leads-and-specialists">Leads and specialists<a href="#leads-and-specialists" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leads and specialists" title="Direct link to Leads and specialists">‚Äã</a></h3><p>For the highest-performing developers, I expect you to be taking care of business. You‚Äôre anticipating and resolving potential client needs without external guidance and ensuring that the code quality is flexible and free of defects. You‚Äôre also making sure the junior developers aren‚Äôt copy-and-pasting us into a corner we can‚Äôt get out of.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="living-up-to-your-own-expectations">Living up to YOUR own expectations<a href="#living-up-to-your-own-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Living up to YOUR own expectations" title="Direct link to Living up to YOUR own expectations">‚Äã</a></h3><p>What I‚Äôve been disappointed with over the past several years, is that folks don‚Äôt seem to be living up to their own expectations. I‚Äôve had to have too many serious conversations with ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù and ‚Äúsenior‚Äù developers where I pull up their code and show them how to fix their own code bases ‚Äî and I‚Äôm just the project manager. </p><p>I want you to be better than that. I try to cultivate a no-blame space on my projects. We all make mistakes, and that‚Äôs okay. What‚Äôs not okay is writing code that causes a growing set of problems as more features are added. Code should become more stable as it ages, not less, but poor coding practices lead to buggy situations.</p><p>If you consider yourself to have moved beyond the realm of junior, then prove it. Write code that other developers find a pleasure to engage with. Even better, write code that works so well, that no one has to to engage it at all, except at the interfaces. </p><p>Okay, that‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm just the project manager with a lot of opinions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember, if someone tells you that the chances of something happening are "next to nil" or "almost impossible" or even "highly unlikely," then the chances are <strong>still non-zero</strong>. </p><blockquote><p>Next to nil isn't zero.</p></blockquote><p>This axiom is clue that something is at risk and you should pay attention to it. It's not statistics that we should worry about it. It's our assumptions.</p><p>Years ago, a developer left some let's say, <em>unflattering</em> comments about Apple (as in the company, not the fruit) in the release notes of our product; release notes managed to get past QA without that comment being caught and into the hands of the client.</p><p>This client happened to be a very large user of MacBooks and was unsurprisingly upset, threatening to cancel their substantial subscription contract with us. The sales team managed to talk the client to stay with our software solution. The developer <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> the <em>lead</em> developer, by the way <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> was admonished and take off the project for his unprofessionalism, but there was still a lot of trust and reputational damage done that we had to continue to overcome for a few more years until the product was sunset.</p><p>The point of the story was that the developer assumed he could get away with putting snarky comments into the code and that either 1) the client wouldn't read the notes or 2) at the very least, QA would catch it. The fact was, there was a better than zero chance of either of those things happening, yet he still did it.</p><p>And this is more than just a story of don't be rude; it's a warning about making assumptions in general. Just because something isn't likely to happen doesn't mean it won't happen, yet I have seen time and time again over the years employees making comments in code, release notes, "internal" emails, CRMs, and instant messaging that if seen by a client (or just their own boss), could set off any number of calamities, the least of which is someone getting fired.</p><p>This goes beyond communication <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> developers make assumptions in about their own code or the code of others all the time which easily lead to run-time crashes, poor performance, and hard-to-refactor code bases.</p><p>The solution for these issues is easy. Keep your professional hat on at work all of the time. </p><p>When it comes to communication, think like a business leader, not like a whiner. Ask yourself if you had your own business, would this be what I want to the client to see or hear? Even comments made in jest <del>can</del> will be interpreted in a fashion you didn't expect.</p><p>When it comes to development, think about your colleagues, those who might inherit your code, and your future self and make sure that your code is DRY, comments are helpful, and your assumptions are checked. Learn more, assume less.</p><p>To some, these might seem like silly issues in the grand scheme of doing business, but the best business will eliminate even the most trivial chances of something going wrong if they can. The best businesses check their assumptions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[From: Lex Fridman's John Carmack Interview]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From: <a href="https://youtu.be/RfWGJS7rckk?t=163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Fridman's John Carmack Interview</a></p><blockquote>It's not the writing of the program initially, it's the whole lifespan of the program.</blockquote><p>No software project worth putting into production is ever truly static. Even a hypothetically bug-free application upon initial release has to change as it gets used in the real world. Users provide feedback so the UX has to change; the product owner or client of the application wants to tweak something; a new platform comes out for it to be deployed to; the app is so popular that it needs to be scaled up <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> any number of circumstances will force a change in software at some point during its lifetime.</p><p>Carmack's comments should remind us of two things:</p><ol><li>The person (or people) who initially wrote the code may not be the same person who has to update the code later on.</li><li>As such, meaningful software should be built with easy maintenance (and easy refactorability) in mind, regardless of who touches the code after initial release.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="client-assumptions">Client Assumptions<a href="#client-assumptions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Client Assumptions" title="Direct link to Client Assumptions">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Experienced developers may take these items as obvious, but the client often does not. Clients <em>assume</em> that the code will be perfect (enough) the first time around. Even if the product is an MVP and the client knows that not all of the features will be in there, they will assume it is a "perfect" MVP. Sure, feature X isn't in the MVP, but we knew that already as part of the plan. <em>BUT</em>, now we can dive into adding feature X perfectly, with no problems, along with all the other features that we left out of the MVP, right?</p><p>No. Devs know this, but clients do not. Clients think the development cycle is <em>additive</em> and fail to see the cyclic and often reactionary parts of software development. This "additive-thinking" (despite the hype and marketing around models like Agile and Lean) is the bane of software development <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> non-developers do not understand that code does not iterate at the feature or user testing level, but at the very root level. One does not simply "add" to code. Every single day, a developer has to juggle a thousand different factors and then share their results meaningfully with the rest of the team, the project manager, the product owner, and other stakeholders. Preliminary assumptions had to have been made at the beginning of the project and those assumptions will change over time as both the developers and the stakeholders see the evolving work become exposed.</p><p>Little does the naive client know, but one small feature tweak, paired with planning that did not take that tweak into account can cause a host of code rewriting, testing, Slack conversations, possibly, worst of all... meetings. (I jest; some meetings are good, especially those set up to clarify and move the project forward quickly.)</p><p>Back to Carmack's statement. One does not write code in the vacuum of a well polished product description guide or detailed statement of work. A well run project keeps the ever evolving nature of development in mind and builds the software with the future in mind. A future where even developers who didn't start the project can easily update the code to the changing needs of the client and their product <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> while this might add considerable time to a project, in the long run, it saves a time and considerable money when developers don't have to re-engineer or debug bad code.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jira is a powerful and highly customizable software project management tool. Because of its popularity and long-time presence in the industry, there is a myriad of add-on and integrations to the platform, including Slack and GitHub.</p><h1>Best Practices</h1><h3>Make it easy for your co-workers NOT to have to ask you questions.</h3><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-general-practices">üëç General Practices<a href="#-general-practices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to üëç General Practices" title="Direct link to üëç General Practices">‚Äã</a></h2><ol><li>You should never be talking about work without also being able to refer to a Jira issue number.</li><li>Think of Jira as a journal. In each issue, record all the details you can think of. While it's best to plan ahead, it's just as valid as to update a Jira issue on the fly or before you transition it or assign it to another person.</li><li>Do not leave an issue in an ambiguous state. Go with the workflow. Tell others what your current state is by transitioning the issue.</li><li>Always provide enough information on an ongoing basis to let your peers and managers what your current status is.</li><li>Anticipate questions and answer them in advance in the issue.</li><li>Add comments, screenshots, and document and web links like crazy.</li><li>Use @mentions vigorously.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="Ô∏è-what-doesnt-need-to-go-in-jira">‚ö†Ô∏è What <em>doesn't</em> need to go in Jira<a href="#Ô∏è-what-doesnt-need-to-go-in-jira" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ô∏è-what-doesnt-need-to-go-in-jira" title="Direct link to Ô∏è-what-doesnt-need-to-go-in-jira">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you're developer, pretty much everything you do needs to be recorded in Jira. If you're working, you're working on a Jira issue, not some abstracted thought.</p><p>However, there are plenty of things that don't need to be recorded as Jira issues. You may refer to these items within an existing Jira issue, but you don't need to create a unique issue for them:</p><p><strong> Jira is <em>not</em>:</strong></p><ul><li>A glorified to-do list.</li><li>A reminder system</li><li>A calendar</li><li>A time-tracking system (though it does track the time it takes you to accomplish your tasks)</li></ul><p>So these are the types of things you don't need to put into Jira:</p><ul><li>Tasks as reminders for meetings - Use a calendar or the /remind feature of Slack.</li><li>Tasks to write documentation - instead, make a note that a task isn't complete until documentation is finished (or create a sub-task).</li><li>Generalized thoughts about what you might want to do. If it isn't distinctly part of the project, don't add it to Jira.</li></ul><h1>Issue Types</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="Ô∏è-tasks--sub-tasks">‚òëÔ∏è Tasks &amp; Sub-tasks<a href="#Ô∏è-tasks--sub-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks &amp; Sub-tasks" title="Direct link to ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks &amp; Sub-tasks">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Task-type issues should be atomic and single purpose. In terms of code, a task should be able to be made with a single commit, usually.</p><ul><li>Task summaries should be actionable.<ul><li>Use imperative, present tense language: ("Change", not "Changed" or "Changes to").</li><li>Write the take with what is expected to happen, not the object that is to be worked on. For example, "Change background color to blue," (good) versus, "Background color blue" (bad). The latter "task" doesn't tell anyone what is supposed to happen. Is the background currently blue? Then what do I do with it?</li></ul></li><li>Tasks should be binary, quantum, discrete, and/or atomic. They should not bleed over into other activities (though they may be dependent on other activities).</li><li>It should be implicitly obvious why the task is needed. If it‚Äôs not clear (or you're not sure), rewrite the summary or add more details in the description.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-the-task-duck">ü¶Ü The Task Duck<a href="#-the-task-duck" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ü¶Ü The Task Duck" title="Direct link to ü¶Ü The Task Duck">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Regardless of the source (Slack, email, conference call, or casual conversation), if it sounds like a task, feels like a task, or acts like a task, then it must be a task. Once you recognize that in yourself or from someone else, create a Task, Story, or Bug in Jira and add details there. Immediately.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-user-stories">üìñ User Stories<a href="#-user-stories" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to üìñ User Stories" title="Direct link to üìñ User Stories">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Stories do not describe a task or activity, they describe an expectation or desire. Story summaries should always be written from an actor's perspective and with a goal in mind:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúAs a <!-- -->[role]<!-- --> I‚Äôd like to/should be able to <!-- -->[activity]<!-- --> because <!-- -->[reason]<!-- -->‚Äù</li><li>‚Äú<!-- -->[Role]<!-- --> should be able to <!-- -->[activity]<!-- --> because <!-- -->[reason]<!-- -->‚Äù</li></ul><p>Stories may take multiple commits to complete and may touch multiple parts of the UI or code. Unlike with Tasks, a Story is not necessarily discrete or atomic. To work with stories, either create Sub-tasks within the Story work on or create full Tasks and link the two tasks together.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-bugs">üêû Bugs<a href="#-bugs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to üêû Bugs" title="Direct link to üêû Bugs">‚Äã</a></h2><p>When a bug is generated, the description field should contain enough information for the assignee to begin work. This includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>How to replicate the bug.</li><li>Under what conditions was the bug found? (e.g, which browser, OS, system, etc).</li><li>What was expected to happen?</li></ul><h1>Labels</h1><p>Use labels as a way to categorize issues that share common features across all projects. For instance, <code>documentation</code> is a good label to use if the issue generated an artifact such as a report, status, or other written asset (make sure to add a web link in the issue as well).</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(and yes, I know, this has very little to do with sprints directly)</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-dont-blame-we-solve">We don't blame, we solve.<a href="#we-dont-blame-we-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We don't blame, we solve." title="Direct link to We don't blame, we solve.">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Easily the biggest hindrance to a successful project is in-fighting and finger-pointing. This isn't a game, nor is it life-or-death. It's a project. We're very smart people trying to solve some very complex problems.
Mistakes will be made. No one will die. Money, on the other hand, may be lost. Let's not let it get to that. Paychecks are nice.</p><p>Our job is to mitigate the potential for mistakes to happen. Ever accidentally delete an in-production database? I have (and I'll tell the story some other time). Two things could have mitigated that (aside from my making a powerfully wrong assumption): 1) Limiting permissions or installing a 'safety catch' (i.e.: forcing function) in the UI and 2) Backups.
We need to think of criteria such as those that we can put in place today so that tomorrow will be less painful for us.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-unstick-in-1-12-hours">How to Unstick in 1-1/2 Hours<a href="#how-to-unstick-in-1-12-hours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Unstick in 1-1/2 Hours" title="Direct link to How to Unstick in 1-1/2 Hours">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Stuck on some code? Here's a heuristic to follow:</p><p>Rubber duck for half an hour; if you can't solve the problem, Slack someone on the project and ask them to pair program/look over your shoulder for one hour.</p><p>Still can't solve it?</p><p>If it can wait, bring it up at the next scrum. If not, Slack, text, or call the scrum master, project manager, or your lead (especially if it's an emergency or a critical issue). The problem may not have been solved, but you will be unstuck nonetheless.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-tasks-and--everyone">Smart Tasks and @-everyone<a href="#smart-tasks-and--everyone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart Tasks and @-everyone" title="Direct link to Smart Tasks and @-everyone">‚Äã</a></h2><blockquote><p>The goal is for us to communicate often and effectively.</p></blockquote><p>If you have concerns that can wait, add the details to the tasks. Bring it up at the scrum (but still document it!)</p><p>If you need help or more context, add details to the task and @-someone(s)
If there are more questions, Slack/Discord, or bring it up at the scrum.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-done-less-perfect-still-works">More Done, Less Perfect, Still Works<a href="#more-done-less-perfect-still-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More Done, Less Perfect, Still Works" title="Direct link to More Done, Less Perfect, Still Works">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We all know this truism, "Perfect is the enemy of done." I get it, but there's a risk we need to manage with that thought process:</p><p>"Done" is useless if the result doesn't work, or causes future hassles.
When writing code, keep the near-term future in mind; how can you make what you are writing easy for other people to interface with and use?</p><p>This brings me to technical debt. Technical debt is okay in very limited doses, and when acknowledged for what it is: debt that will either need to be repaid, or written-off. Both have consequences.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-more-you-document-the-less-you-have-to-explain-to-a-point">The More You Document the Less You Have to Explain (to a point)<a href="#the-more-you-document-the-less-you-have-to-explain-to-a-point" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The More You Document the Less You Have to Explain (to a point)" title="Direct link to The More You Document the Less You Have to Explain (to a point)">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There's an art to this. Write documentation too early, and it goes stale. You've wasted your time. Write it too late, or too long, or too boring, or make it incomplete and you'll be answering questions anyway.
Start with bullets.</p><blockquote><p>When in doubt, add caveats.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>WIP is only useful if it's actually a work in progress. Don't tease us like that.</p></blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> is fantastic if it's short enough to be read and still conveys meaning.</p><p><strong>Headers</strong> help you organize and give your readers focus.</p><p>Robust documentation means not assuming what your reader knows. For consumer-grade docs (and this means API docs too) have someone dumb like me read it first. Find someone new to read it who has to literally go over each step ‚Äî if they get stuck, you made an assumption. Correct it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hiring software developers is notoriously hard to do, even for those of us who are technically savvy. Hiring developers is like buying a book; just because the editorial blurb on the back is great doesn't make the writing great.</p><p>If you have a project that is more than just a single-page website, you'll need to hire a development shop (or go through the effort of hiring your own staff, which is a very different topic) to do the heavy lifting. Your project may be starting from scratch, or maybe your existing application is buggy or not very scalable and you need to refresh it. For whatever reason, you recognize that hiring a person off of Fiverr, Upwork, or Freelancer just isn't going to hack it. You're already on the right track.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cost">Cost<a href="#cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cost" title="Direct link to Cost">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Let's just get this out of the way. No matter how you look at it, good software development is <em>expensive</em>. There's simply no way around it. The tale of the single coder pumping out a full-fledged application in a single day is a farce.</p><p>So what can you expect in the way of cost? Depends on the project and the skill set you're hiring for.</p><ul><li>Simple Website Adjustments/Fixes: $40 - $60/hour for 10 to 60 hours.</li><li>Basics Single Page Web Application: $50 - $100/hour for 20 to 100 hours.</li><li>Fullstack Web Application: $75 - $125/hour for 500+ hours.</li><li>Enterprise-grade Application: $100 - $200/hour for six or more months.</li></ul><p>And to be clear, this is the hourly rate of a <em>single</em> developer. A good team will include three to four developers at least, and for complex projects, a project manager and UI/UX specialist will need to be included. This doesn't include the need for a graphic designer (which you would usually hire separately to work with the team).</p><p>So, yeah. Expensive.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-silver-lining-on-cost">A Silver Lining on Cost<a href="#a-silver-lining-on-cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Silver Lining on Cost" title="Direct link to A Silver Lining on Cost">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The good news is usually a dev shop will offer a blended rate that is less than the average rate of the individual developers (and project manager and UI/UX specialist). They can offer this because a team is made up of more than just one type of developer and they do not all work eight hours a day, five days a week. Experienced developers and a good project manager can help improve the value you get from the team through higher quality code, delivered faster, and with greater degrees of communication.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-a-flat-rate">What About a Flat Rate?<a href="#what-about-a-flat-rate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What About a Flat Rate?" title="Direct link to What About a Flat Rate?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you're requesting software that isn't particularly complex (at least from the initial concept you provide), then the shop may be able to offer a flat rate. This is more cost-effective for you, but if your project requires more work than anticipated, then you run the risk of overage costs (which are often built into the contract). It doesn't hurt to ask, but be aware unless the shop has done similar work, they'll likely insist on an hourly rate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="offshore">Offshore?<a href="#offshore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Offshore?" title="Direct link to Offshore?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Yes, they can often be less expensive on an hourly basis... but there are consequences to going offshore. To keep it short, time zones alone make working with off-shore developers prohibitively expensive in terms of sanity and lifestyle rather than cost. Cultural and language barriers will get in the way as well, and unless you're well versed in the technologies being used and actually can keep track of the details of the work being done, you can be bamboozled with absolutely no recourse to fall back on.</p><p>There are off-shore organizations that are great to work with, but generally speaking, they are 1) hard to find and 2) only nominally less expensive to work with since they already know they're great to work with.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-and-schedule">Time and Schedule<a href="#time-and-schedule" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Time and Schedule" title="Direct link to Time and Schedule">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Often, the earliest question asked by a potential client to the development shop is "How long do you think it will take?" If they respond casually back with a number, consider not using them. Why?</p><p>Software development is inherently non-deterministic. Unlike building a house, which has predictable (relatively speaking) actions that can be timed and calculated to determine a schedule, it is very hard to know how long it will take to develop most software. There are simply too many different ways that things can go wrong and won't crop up until well into the development cycle.</p><p>Rough estimates can be given, but you should always anticipate a set of caveats to accompany those estimates.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="agile-to-the-rescue">Agile to the... Rescue?<a href="#agile-to-the-rescue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Agile to the... Rescue?" title="Direct link to Agile to the... Rescue?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>You may have heard the words "Agile," "Scrum," "Kanban," or "Lean Development" bandied about. Agile is the umbrella term for a set of project management methodologies that originated partially in manufacturing and partially in software development.</p><p>A typical Agile project will release a version of your software to you every two weeks or so, demonstrating the progress that has been made. This process gives you a real sense of the work needed, and the confidence that your project is moving forward. The worst, in theory, that can happen is your project is off by two weeks because something has to be undone and corrected.</p><p>It's not a panacea, however, and certainly cannot predict how long the project will ultimately take. A lot of that depends on you, the client, and how often you make requests to change things. The more significant the changes, the longer it will take. But the end result should, if all has gone well, be a product that works well, the way you want, and the way that your customers will enjoy and gladly pay for.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-vetting-process">The Vetting Process<a href="#the-vetting-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Vetting Process" title="Direct link to The Vetting Process">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The first thing you need to do is vet the dev shop. This means having a call with them so you can explain your idea, get a feel for personalities, and hear their story and perspective on the level of effort it will take to approach your project.</p><p>An honest shop will tell you if they think they're the right fit for the job or not. They may acknowledge that they are not the perfect fit, and that's okay. They still may work if other factors such as cost, personality, contracts, and management all make sense.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ndas">NDAs<a href="#ndas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NDAs" title="Direct link to NDAs">‚Äã</a></h3><p>You may have heard the aphorism of "An idea is only as good as its execution." Basically, you may have a great idea, but if you don't do anything with it, then it's worth nothing. A lot of people fear sharing their ideas with others, especially dev shops because they might have the skill and talent to execute.</p><p>True, they may. But it's highly unlikely they will. With the exception of huge corporations who have unlimited resources, even the biggest of dev shops are <em>not</em> going to spend the time to verify that the idea even works, much less make the financial investment in time and resources to work on something that is probably not in their domain of expertise. They could be making money with another client instead, where the success or failure of the idea is on the client, not on themselves (assuming the dev team did a good job in implementing the details).</p><p>Most dev shops will sign an NDA if you like. You can provide one of your own, but likely they'll provide one.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asking-questions">Asking Questions<a href="#asking-questions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Asking Questions" title="Direct link to Asking Questions">‚Äã</a></h3><p>You should feel free to ask any question, even "dumb" ones. No good shop will make you feel silly or uncomfortable. A good shop will encourage questions, offer suggestions, and like I'm doing here, tell you what you should expect should you choose to take your business elsewhere. There is nothing lost in providing goodwill.</p><p>What questions should you ask? Good question!</p><p>The big questions have been addressed already: Cost and Time. If those don't scare you off, then it's time to start asking these sorts of questions:</p><ol><li>Who owns the code?</li></ol><ul><li>Typically, you would own the code. As such, you should have access to it any time, usually through a repository service such as GitHub. You'll have to pay for such services to keep them private (the free versions leave your code exposed, which is great for open source software, not so great for entrepreneurs).</li><li>A dev shop may use open source code to develop your project; this is customary, expected, and fine. You will not own that part of the code, of course. If a special custom library would help the development along, you would be responsible for paying for the license and thus also own the license.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Who will maintain the code and services?</li></ol><ul><li>After the project is done, the software doesn't simply live in a vacuum. Maintenance still needs to happen for things like scaling up servers, applying security patches, monitoring the service, and so on. The dev shop will typically offer that service; the overall rate for providing it will be far less than development and will often be restricted to a certain number of hours per month.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>How will the project be managed?</li></ol><ul><li>If you have a small project needing only a single full-stack developer, then that developer may be enough to run the project. The developer may bring on specialists for certain parts of the code, but often that will be behind the scenes and self-managed.</li><li>For larger projects needing three or more developers, ideally, the dev shop will provide a project manager. This is the person you engage with on regular basis and who "translates" your needs into the actions the developers will take (this is a vast oversimplification of the process, but I think you get the point).</li><li>You should get regular updates regarding the projects. More importantly, you should feel free and able to ask questions and make requests at any time. A good project manager will discuss those request with you to make sure it fits within the scope of the work.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li>How do you like to communicate?</li></ol><ul><li>The dev shop will generally communicate in a way that best works for you. However, if you're flexible, the shop may offer its own solution, such as bringing you into a project-specific channel on Slack or other instant messaging services.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-things-to-listen-for">Other things to listen for:<a href="#other-things-to-listen-for" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other things to listen for:" title="Direct link to Other things to listen for:">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you don't hear any of these words mentioned, don't panic. The dev shop may not want to burden you with too much techno-babble. If you do hear these words, then at least on the surface, they <em>might</em> know what they're talking about:</p><blockquote>user interface, user experience, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Javascript, Scrum, Agile, Kanban, Jira, Microsoft Teams, BitBucket, Git, GitHub, repository, codebase, object-oriented, procedural, functional, lambda, elastic, application program interfaces (APIs), web sockets, Ajax, Node JS, React JS/Native, Angular JS, Vue JS, PHP, Python, Django... and so, so much more</blockquote><p>Mind you, this might mean they've read this article or are really good at speaking techno-babble. But it's a start.</p><p><strong>More importantly</strong>, if you don't hear them speaking about your project, your needs, and your expectations, that's a bigger warning sign than being able to spout out a litany of software words.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scoping-the-project">Scoping the Project<a href="#scoping-the-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scoping the Project" title="Direct link to Scoping the Project">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Lastly, at least as far as looking for a good dev shop is concerned, is asking about how the project will be scoped. That is, despite the vagaries of software development I've already highlighted, what is it that will actually be worked on, what is the rough timeline, and what is expected of both parties?</p><p>Before you sign to fully commit to using a dev shop, make sure you get and carefully read over what is often called a "Statement of Work."</p><p>This document, at a minimum, will take several hours of work on the part of the dev shop, possibly several days if it's a complex project. You may be requested to pay a flat fee for creating this document for such large projects.</p><p>What you should see in a statement of work are enough details to satisfy you that the development shop actually listened to what your project is about and read any documents that you may have shared with them (highly recommended to do so; if you don't have documentation of your own, you may not be ready to start on a large project). To be clear, what it won't contain is a line-by-line list of things that are going to be done. The statement of work is a high-level document, not a recipe.</p><p>The shop should be fairly specific in what they will and <em>won't</em> do. What they won't do is just as important and usually means two things: You're protected from developers doing miscellaneous work that isn't really needed and the shop can push back on you if you try to insist on adding new features or functions that weren't anticipated the beginning of the project.</p><p>The statement of work will also clearly state the deliverables to be handed over at the end of the project. This should include at the very least the code base, documentation, and if applicable items like configuration and security files. Again, the specifics should be enough, but not overly detailed <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> no company can tell you everything up front; if they could, they should charge you a flat rate for cost.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="notes-on-complexity">Notes on Complexity<a href="#notes-on-complexity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notes on Complexity" title="Direct link to Notes on Complexity">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Software development has gotten easier over the decades, but in exchange, the problems being solved are dramatically more complex. Most people think that an application, be it Gmail or Netflix on the web, or Excel and Word on the desktop consists of just the graphic and interface they see and interact with on a daily basis.</p><p>Aside from the work assuring that the workflow is pleasurable to work with, the user interface is actually one of the easier parts of the development process, at least coding-wise. Where it gets complicated is behind the scenes, with the administrative interfaces and the infrastructure setup and all the layers in between, to the sides, and on top of the interface, the end-user sees.</p><p>Keep this all in mind when the statement of work is presented to you, as well as when trying to plan for the costs and schedules of your project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts<a href="#concluding-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concluding Thoughts" title="Direct link to Concluding Thoughts">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There's a lot to ponder when hiring a development shop for the project of your dreams. Costs will likely run higher than you think, partly because of the persistent myth of the Fiverr-hired cowboy coder whipping out an application in one day on the cheap which highlights the reality of software development: In this modern age, coding is easy to learn, but it's incredibly difficult to execute well, especially at the enterprise scale.</p><p>Schedules will be unpredictable. Again with the housing metaphor, software development is nothing like the repetitive business of erecting walls, installing plumbing and electricity, and finishing the place before (and as someone whose done that work in the past, I can tell you it's also not easy, but it's still mostly predictable).</p><p>And no matter the size of the project, you're going to have to expect problems to crop up that will seem trivial, but turn out to be far mor difficult than expected to solve. You'll have to be comfortable knowing you'll never be able to verify if that extra work was necessary, but an good dev shop will be more than willing to explain the details to you if you want. A good shop wants to educate you and make you a smarter participant in the project because it will make their job that much easier.</p><p>I hope this article has given you enough food for thought. If you want to know more, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be glad to discuss the details of your search for a great development shop that works for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Take this with a grain of salt. While a department or two (or a dozen) might be using the software, the entire company is likely not using the software. The software is simply another tool to them. Don't equate quality with the size of the company using it.</p><p>For reference, as of the date of these, here's a list of PM tools I found on the Internet. Not all of these are purely PM tools. Many are hybrids, focusing on other activities, but are often found associated with PM software.</p><p>Asana |

title="http://trello.com" width="212" height="64" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Disclaimer: I like Trello. It's a dang good piece of software that I've been using the free version of for years, well before Atlassian bought it out from Fog Creek Software (now Glitch.com). That said, this isn't intended to be an endorsement for Trello or Atlassian for that matter.</p><p>Even at its most basic (free) level, Trello has a lot of cool functionality that lets your team run wild with managing projects, setting up calendar events, making to-do lists, setting up workflows and so on. But here's the thing with Trello ‚Äî when you buy into the Business Class level at $10 per user per month (paid annually), you gain a whole lot of new features.</p><p>In particular, suddenly you go from having a measly maximum of 10 boards to <strong><em>Unlimited</em></strong> boards! So exciting! üëè
Not just that, but you get a whole smorgasbord of new things to play with. Look at this outrageous list!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Trello Pricing Tiers|50%" src="/assets/images/trello_pricing-660eb45528585b96184de6dac7915020.png" title="http://trello.com/pricing" width="837" height="1013" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ooo. Map view! Priority support even! Seriously, that's a lot to take in. But I digress.</p><p>What about those juicy unlimited features? Tempting, right? Think of all of the boards you could create or all of the files you could upload or the number of cards that you and your team could wash the entire world with! No idea, thought, or daydream would go unwritten.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hold-your-own-dang-beer">Hold your own dang beer!<a href="#hold-your-own-dang-beer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hold your own dang beer!" title="Direct link to Hold your own dang beer!">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Trello isn't the only bit of software that offers unlimited whatever. Most software services out there offer their own flavor of unlimited feature types. "Unlimited" is often just a side-effect of running these types of services in the cloud.</p><p>For all practical purposes, there's no way any company ‚Äî or even a lot of companies ‚Äî is going to use up so much space or use so many features as to impact an online service like Trello, Asana, or Monday.com down even a little (assuming it's well managed high up in there in the clouds. That's where your money goes, by the way, into the clouds‚òÅÔ∏è‚õÖÔ∏èüå©).</p><p>But that doesn't stop people from taking "unlimited" as a challenge. In the case of Trello, I've seen a few organizations and individuals who have a board for every imaginable process, project, and problem they can imagine. And within those boards, there are an unfathomable number of cards. If these boards and cards were real and not digital, city streets and interstate highways would be paved in them.</p><blockquote>Unlimited doesn't mean, "hold my beer."üç∫</blockquote><p>Essentially, these organizations and folks are practicing a digital version of hoarding. There ends up being so much un-managed content that they have no idea what their next steps are supposed to be, or where they need to go, or what they need to do. They get so lost in the act of creation they forget they have actual work that needs to be done.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sit-a-spell-wouldya">Sit a Spell, Would'ya?<a href="#sit-a-spell-wouldya" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sit a Spell, Would'ya?" title="Direct link to Sit a Spell, Would'ya?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>For one company, I set up their software project management system using Atlassian's other big player, Jira, and its companions, Confluence, Bamboo, and Bitbucket.</p><p>We had a multi-billion dollar budget. Paying for all of the features we were using with the Atlassian suite was worth the money we were paying them so that our staff of over two hundred people could concentrate on their areas of expertise. Once I got the system up and running, the software development hummed along quite nicely... for the most part, but that's a story for a different time (to paraphrase: nothing ever goes as planned when implemented in reality).</p><blockquote>Nothing ever goes as planned when implemented in reality.</blockquote><p>Despite the large team, the even larger corporate sponsor, and the ability to create an unlimited number of Jira Projects, I restricted it to just nine projects. Why nine?</p><p>Because we had seven products, an R&amp;D team, and a science team and that's all we needed. A bulk of the software developers and UI/UX designers were working on the seven products; each product had features to be built and deadlines to be met and were assigned teams. The R&amp;D team did their own thing and I and the rest of management didn't want them polluting the other projects. And the science team rarely engaged anyone outside of their esoteric holdings on a faraway land; besides, they used Confluence way more than Jira anyway.</p><p>We didn't need more than nine projects, so we didn't create more projects than nine.</p><p>More precisely, I prevented anyone from trying to create more projects. I was the gatekeeper, following the rules and guidelines we'd established for the organization. Our goal was to foster cooperation and transparency. A myriad of unsanctioned projects and mismanaged documentation facilitated neither.</p><blockquote>Your system should foster cooperation and transparency.</blockquote><p>It's not like I didn't get continuous requests to set up new projects all the time, especially in the beginning as we were ramping up the organization as a whole. Devs, designers and project managers alike would ask, "Can you create a project for me?" It showed a fundamental misunderstanding of organizational logistics and management. It also showed how many folks didn't pay attention during our kickoff meetings for each major project.</p><p>In those early days, I had a lot of communicating to do, but the requests waned as I began to understand the details of their needs and adjust the existing projects accordingly, and as people could see the value of constraint.</p><blockquote>Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.</blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-project-or-not-to-project">To Project or Not to Project?<a href="#to-project-or-not-to-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to To Project or Not to Project?" title="Direct link to To Project or Not to Project?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I always had a key set of questions to ask would-be new project advocates:</p><ol><li>Is the work to be done for this new project endorsed by upper management? That is, is it for a product we're actually going to make to sell? Something that the company is willing to put considerable time, money, and resources behind?</li><li>Does the work being done have any dependencies on the existing projects? I discovered oftentimes people just wanted a workspace away from the main project they were working on. Developers in particular made this request a lot... I suspect it comes from the (very good) habit of branching code. The answer was inevitably yes, there was some dependency, so I'd point them to the appropriate project.</li><li>Who is going to lose visibility into this work? The reason for this question was mainly for the sake of the project management office. Any extra, unsanctioned project in Jira meant an extra place to go scrounging around to find data. Far better to have all the details in one main project block, something that Jira excels at providing services for, assuming one understands Jira permissions, Agile development, and project management as a whole.</li></ol><blockquote>Is it sanctioned by upper management? Are there dependencies on existing projects? Will anyone lose visibility to data?</blockquote><p>The only times I created a new project (before we hit our max of seven product projects) was when we legitimately had an actual product to begin working on. Jira project creation was part of the initial product plan, in fact. No one could actually begin full work until the project was created in Jira (along with Git, the physical labs, testing suites, document repositories, and so on...)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-land-of-unlimited-options-is-a-farce">The Land of Unlimited Options is a Farce.<a href="#the-land-of-unlimited-options-is-a-farce" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Land of Unlimited Options is a Farce." title="Direct link to The Land of Unlimited Options is a Farce.">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I attribute the desire to create projects and boards willy-nilly with the American culture of unlimited everything. Unlimited minutes, unlimited breadsticks, unlimited channels, unlimited fries, unlimited speech, unlimited options to make a fool of oneself (which, you know, happens to all of us from time to time. Don't beat yourself up for mistakes. Learn and move on).</p><p>But there is freedom in constraint. By purposely channeling your organizational efforts into a small set of projects, governed by a small set of rules and guided by best practices, you're forced into thinking creatively about how to manage a wide variety of situations. By purposely limiting choices, there are less decisions to make and fewer opportunities for things to haywire, giving you, and everyone else, more time.</p><blockquote>There is freedom in constraint.</blockquote><p>Systems can get complex very quickly. By controlling expansion, modularizing it, and planning how one sub-system might integrate with another sub-system, you and your peers (in project management, IT services, and other departments), can ensure within a reasonable level of comfort that if anything goes wrong, it can be easily fixed or unwound and more importantly, everyone on various teams can have a clear understanding of their small part of the big picture. You minimize the risk of losing visibility to critical information and maximize the workflow and productivity of the players in the system. A nice side-effect is that the system is easy to duplicate as well. You can take the same practices and apply them elsewhere.</p><blockquote>You minimize the risk of losing visibility to critical information and maximize the workflow and productivity of the players in the system.</blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-should-run-the-land-of-projects">Who Should Run the Land of Projects?<a href="#who-should-run-the-land-of-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who Should Run the Land of Projects?" title="Direct link to Who Should Run the Land of Projects?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>You might think that project managers would be the ideal candidates for setting up a project management system. After all, that's their domain specialty, right?</p><p>Well, yes, it is their specialty, and no they are not the right candidates for setting up project systems ‚Äî or resource planning systems, customer relations management systems, so on. Oftentimes, anyone who is a domain expert for what the system is used for is too close to the issues at hand to understand the sometimes very intricate relations between all of the parts of the system. Importantly, they are unlikely to see the external connections that may be needed and future problems that might arise, and thus not plan for such criteria.</p><p>In a large company, consider finding or hiring someone who is simply an expert in such systems setup and put them to work (yes, in case you're wondering, that would be someone like me). If you're hiring internally for such a position, IT and DevOps folks with good people skills are ideal. Don't hire someone just because they claim to be a domain expert; like I mentioned, project/program/product managers (even with a vaunted PMP certification) are rarely ideal candidates to set up a project management system, even one as rudimentary as Trello.</p><p>For smaller companies, on a limited budget, look for that person who likes to tweak settings on apps; someone who combines a knack for details with a bit of technical expertise. It's important that they get along with people as well, because there's a lot of communication and collaboration required to get a firm grip on how the broader organization works (or would like to work). Bring in someone to consult for a few hours, at least for the initial planning phases so you can get your victi... I mean employee headed in the right direction.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-back-on-board">Getting Back on Board<a href="#getting-back-on-board" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Back on Board" title="Direct link to Getting Back on Board">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Most software, at a particular level of pricing, effectively has "unlimited" versions of least a few features (if you can't ever hit a number limitation, then it's effectively unlimited to your organization).</p><p>Trello boards are unlimited, as are cards, power-ups, storage, and even members. That doesn't mean you should have the same view of those services the way a cow looks at an endless sea of tall grass. Just because you can create unlimited boards doesn't mean you should.</p><p>The key takeaway is that before you consider adding the Nth board so that your team(s) can fill it with X number of cards (for large values of X), consider how you could achieve the same goal in your current work environment. If, after a bit of serious consideration and analysis, you do decide to create a new board (or project or whatever), make sure that there was a rule that you followed to justify its creation. If there wasn't one, add it to your existing list of rules (and if you don't have a list of rules, make one).</p><blockquote>Make sure you follow your company's rules of order and organization.</blockquote><p>I think you'll find that, over time, your system will function more smoothly and people around you will be more productive ‚Äî and you'll know this to be true because you'll be able to easily see the truth in the limited number of projects you'll need to look into.
And as always, if you have any questions or you and your organization are suffering from an over-abundance of projects, reach out to me. I'll always make time to have a quick chat about what your situation is like.</p><p>ENDSüç∫</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em></em></p><h3><em>Or, When and Why You Should Pay for Notion Team</em></h3><p></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-up-to-speed">Getting up to Speed<a href="#getting-up-to-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting up to Speed" title="Direct link to Getting up to Speed">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you haven't heard of Notion, likely you've been under a rock somewhere. And good for you, keeping safe during this time of Covid-19! üò∑</p><p>Notion touts itself as an all-in-one workspace, useful to create wikis, track notes, make tables of who-knows-what and a whole host of other features. Think Evernote meets Airtable smashed up with Microsoft OneNote, and MediaWiki, with a pinch of Asana and Trello, plus a lot more. And Notion is hyper-configurable, to boot.</p><p>It's a handy and versatile software suite. But like those other tools just mentioned, there is so much that you can do with Notion that sometimes it can be so overwhelming that you collapse under an avalanche of unorganized notes, links, folders and files.
If you want to know more, visit <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.notion.so/</a>. Chances are, you can ramp up pretty quickly. However... this article isn't about the details of what Notion can do. It's about saving yourself a lot of time and effort if you are thinking that Notion might be perfect for your team or business. It might be, but...</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-trap-that-is-notion-personal">The Trap that is Notion Personal<a href="#the-trap-that-is-notion-personal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Trap that is Notion Personal" title="Direct link to The Trap that is Notion Personal">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Once you see how much you can do with Notion ‚Äî and just in the free Personal version ‚Äî it's tempting to upgrade to the Personal Pro (only $4 a month, after all!) and get all the goodies that come with it, mainly unlimited uploads and unlimited guests.
It's a bargain! Look at all of the amazing things you can do! Pages and pages of notes and links and files and sub-folders and... wow, all of the guests that can be invited! It's enough to make your head spin.</p><p>And it's also tempting at this point to think you can run a business with this amazing piece of software for just a measly $4 per month! Look how frugal you are! üëè</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="It&amp;#39;s a Trap Image|50%" src="/assets/images/its_a_trap-2f0a5ae390a76ef2b4c6c9b118272f42.jpg" title="Source: http://www.deviantart.com/kevinbolk/art/It-s-A-Trap-Badge-197791923" width="317" height="493" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Heads up... you can't run business on $4 a month. Well, you can try, but someone on your "team" will be spending so much time administering to Notion that the $4 you spend per month will be eclipsed by the cost of having that someone constantly distracted.</p><p>It's not like Notion is trying to bamboozle you. You're just using the wrong tool for the job. Let's take a look at their pricing page:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Notion Pricing Image" src="/assets/images/notion_pricing-36d63121de0b0db7e3d429c129c53478.png" title="See? Teamwork!" width="1000" height="257" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>See? The $8 per member per month to run Notion for your team and rather than just your selfish self. Your Personal Pro account, amazing as it is for you, isn't intended for use with teams. You know... those people you pay to make things, sell things, and fix things for you? Yes, the Team level is going to cost more... but is it worth it?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-side-note">A Side Note<a href="#a-side-note" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Side Note" title="Direct link to A Side Note">‚Äã</a></h3><p>To be clear, I'm not shillin' for Notion at all. It's a good piece of software, but only if you're willing to use it correctly and can take the time to organize it so that it enhances your team's productivity, rather than detracts.
I could say the same about a host of workspace-cum-project management-cum-digital notebook software suites. They are often well-priced, but only if you can use the software to its near full potential.</p><p>My preferred tool, mostly because of my familiarity with it and my being a software developer/project manager, is Atlassian's Jira (and associated apps, like Confluence). Like Notion, Jira seems simple to set up and use at first glance, but once you realize the true power of the underlying features, you can get lost forever in a sea of potential options and confuse the heck out of the users of your system. That's why it's good to have a dedicated administrator for such tools ‚Äî they can be part time for a small company, but for a large company, ideally they should be full time. A consultant familiar with organizational systems can also be useful to hire for the initial ramp up or a mid-game evaluation (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).</p><blockquote><p>It's good to have a dedicated administrator for such tools.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-the-answer-is">And the Answer Is...<a href="#and-the-answer-is" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And the Answer Is..." title="Direct link to And the Answer Is...">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you're committed to using Notion for your team or company, then yes, absolutely, it is worth paying the $8 per member per month to get the Team feature, paid annually.
The main reason is that the Team version of Notion gives you an exponential jump in the level of control you have over what your members and guests can see. You see, it's the permissions that you are paying all of that filthy lucre for. üí∏</p><blockquote><p>It's all about the permissions</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-grant-thee-permission-to">I Grant Thee Permission to...<a href="#i-grant-thee-permission-to" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I Grant Thee Permission to..." title="Direct link to I Grant Thee Permission to...">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Well managed permissions make multi-user systems like Notion far easier to work with. I'd even argue that before you even consider how you might organize the structure of your wondrous note-taking, wiki-building, link-making, table-hosting empire, you first look at how you want permissions to be handled.
Who has access to what? Do the software devs need to see Project X? Does the sales department need insight into documents about Subject Y?
Notion, if you're willing to put in more sophisticated work, will let you track finances and contracts, do HR stuff, manage project details and act as an Agile-Scrum-Kanban monster hybrid for product development. Who gets to see what? And why or why not?</p><p>Asking these questions can help drive the formation of the folder structure of Notion and make it more manageable and scalable over time, which is why I recommend starting with permissions first. Then, if sometime in the future, there's a need for significant changes, you already have a solid foundation of understanding from where you can regard how, when, and why you might make such updates ‚Äî and those changes will likely be easier to make as well.
My one suggestion with managing permissions is to start broad at first, then restrict down as needed. Think at the (sub-)team level and (sub-)folder, but not any lower than that. Don't make permissions assignment overly complicated, don't make it a way to control individuals, and don't confuse permissions with some sort of security feature. They're not.</p><blockquote><p>When creating permission rules, it's good to start broad at first, then restrict down as needed.</p></blockquote><p>A corollary to my security comment: If something truly needs to be legally protected, such as truly sensitive IP ‚Äî along the lines of Coca-Cola's secret formula ‚Äî you shouldn't even ponder putting it a place like Notion. ‚ö†Ô∏è</p><blockquote><p>Permissions ‚â† Security</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-yeah">So yeah...<a href="#so-yeah" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So yeah..." title="Direct link to So yeah...">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you have a team of two or more, it's worth paying the $8 per member per month to use.</p><p>(Oh, by the way, for Notion, that's $8 per month if you pay annually, otherwise it's $10 per month. The Personal Pro shoots to the sky-high price of... $5 per month.)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-takeaways">The Takeaways<a href="#the-takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Takeaways" title="Direct link to The Takeaways">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The first takeaway of this article is simple: If you have a legit existing and/or promising company with people eager to work for you (hopefully paid), then there is great value in paying the extra cost for a system in order to get the most out of it. In the case of Notion, that means fronting the $8 per member per month for access to permissions so that you have a true multi-user system to work within. It's a clever thing that Notion has done, setting their pricing that way, and I applaud the distinction.</p><blockquote><p>There is great value in paying the extra cost for a system in order to get the most out of it.</p></blockquote><p>But the rule applies even if you're choosing a completely different software suite to do something completely different: if you like the features in the freemium/cheap model, pay the extra cost to get access to the grander features. You should more than make up for the cost in terms of productivity alone. Most good software companies put considerable thought into their pricing structure (though I'll admit, I've seen my fair share of willy-nilly pricing for features ‚Äî a rule of thumb, if they don't advertise their pricing on the web or at least give you an easy way to get a price range with a quick call or email... they just might be bamboozling you. I'm assuming you don't need enterprise level software; that's a different ball of wax).</p><p>The second takeaway is that permissions are supremely useful. Jira uses them, Notion uses them, Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, Asana, Monday.com and other project management software suites use them... all for good reason. More than anything, permissions offer an underlying solution to improving the user experience of software that applies to users, guests, and administrators alike. If you think about permissions as a way to improve workflow, rather than to restrict it, you're on the right track.</p><blockquote><p>If you think about permissions as a way to improve workflow, rather than to restrict it, you're on the right track.</p></blockquote><p>The last takeaway is this: Notion and all other software that is more sophisticated than calculator or to-do list often requires a commitment on the part of someone in your organization. Superficially, it's about knowing what the top level useful features are and how to implement them. However, it takes a deeper mindset, or a lot of previous experience, to set up a system that is robust, easily configurable, and sustainable. It also takes quite a bit of will power to resist the horde of unprofessional opinions that will fly your system administrator's way on how best to implement the system. Some will be gems, but most will actually send your system down a detrimental path, if not immediately, in the long run. All systems suffer from the decay of entropy ‚Äî doubly so when created by committee.</p><blockquote><p>All systems suffer from the decay of entropy ‚Äî doubly so when created by committee.</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of what system you are (planning on) using, be it something like Notion or Airtable, or Jira, Monday.com or Asana, or maybe something more sophisticated such as an enterprise level CRM or ERP, feel free to reach out so I can help (I give you permission!).</p><p><em>ENDS</em> üëë</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I missed my very first payment of rent at my new apartment. Imagine my surprise when I found a notice to vacate on my door. I quickly fixed the problem with the property managers; apparently the auto-pay system didn‚Äôt go through, despite my double-checking all the numbers. They forgave the late fee <!-- -->[‚Äújust this once!‚Äù]<!-- --> and moved on.</p><p>I didn‚Äôt move on, at least for twenty or so minutes. I felt mildly guilty and very embarrassed. What a way to start living in a new apartment complex! I was blaming myself for a mistake anyone could have made.</p><p>For what, exactly, am I blaming myself for, I had to ask? A typo? A computer glitch? Forgetting to check my calendar? </p><p>A lot of my sense of guilt has come from the sorts of experiences like these I‚Äôve had in my past. In my mind‚Äôs eye, I grew up in a culture that was oriented toward blaming others for problems <!-- -->‚Äî<!-- --> and as a result, I gained the habit of blaming myself for the tiniest of infractions. If I blame myself, I reasoned, I won‚Äôt be blamed so often by others.</p><p>How wrong I‚Äôd been on that.</p><p>I‚Äôve been blamed for a lot of things, mostly things that I had no control over. As a nine year old boy at school, I saw some other kids run away from the window of our second story classroom. Curious, I glanced out the window only to see a teacher down below suddenly accusing me of who-knows-what. My first detention ever.</p><p>Decades later, in a full time job, I highlighted a potential problem in the computer system and proposed a solution. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre not going to implement that change. We have better things to do.‚Äù Mind you, they hired me for exactly this sort of troubleshooting.</p><p>A few months later, the system crashed; the culprit? The very problem I had pointed out. And then I was promptly blamed for the crash.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt have you making that mistake again‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhat? Not forcing you to make changes?‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYes, pretty much.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>What?!?</p><p>Problems arise, mistakes happen, and both people and things break.  That doesn‚Äôt mean that there is always a culprit, or that anything was done with mal intent. More likely a problem arose out of ignorance or misperception. Keeping that in mind, I think it‚Äôs important for us to not blame others so often and so readily.  Blaming others has an impact that we might not see immediately. Hold blame over a child, rightly or wrongly, and that will last into their adulthood. Blame an adult, and problems won‚Äôt get solved and resentment will build. In most social situations, I feel we often blame people to resolve our innate sense of justice. But where is the justice in making someone feel bad?</p><p>In another job, earlier in my career, I made a very, very costly mistake. I took full responsibility for it, and was sure I was going to be fired. I went to my boss‚Äôs office and begged for his forgiveness and understood if he needed to let me go.</p><p>All he said was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sorry. Just don‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù Those were some of the most profound words I‚Äôd ever been told. He didn‚Äôt blame me for anything. He just wanted me to learn a lesson. It changed a lot in my career. I was super-cautious about the future actions I took, because I didn‚Äôt want a repeat of such a massive, near career ender, but I also felt more emboldened. I wasn‚Äôt sorry for myself. I felt I could actually take more risks in some ways. I just needed to be more careful as I took those risks. </p><p>That comment went through my head again today, all these years later, as I pondered the rent problem that arose. I can‚Äôt feel sorry for myself; I didn‚Äôt do anything even remotely as bad as I did on the job back then. Nothing was truly on the line today; the system I expected to work a particular way hiccuped and I failed to pay the rent on time. I fixed it, have a backup plan, and now I‚Äôm moving on.</p><p>Life is complex. We can‚Äôt have a fix for everything; we can‚Äôt prevent all the mistakes, large and small from happening. However, we can take the time to restrain ourselves from blaming others too readily and especially to not blame ourselves for the act of being human. Instead, we should correct what we can and move on. We learn, we adapt, we improve, and we make more mistakes because<!-- -->‚Ä¶<!-- --> Life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dry. Dull. Bland. Banal. </p><p>Sometimes our use of language is so uninspired that it leaves the taste of chalk in a listener's ears. They close their eyes in order to retain precious moisture and they fidget in their seats as if sitting on a plump desert cactus.</p><p>Sometimes we don't even try. Count how many "really, really's" and you'll hear what I mean. What can we do to brighten our language?</p><p><em>Color</em> your words! Language is a moldable art form. There are thousands upon thousands of ways to delight and tingle the listeners' ears. Listen to yourself as you speak. What do you hear? Are you, yourself, inspired, intrigued, or moved? If not, then consider picking up a box of word crayons and color outside your normal lines.</p><p>Make use of metaphors and similes as if you were the author of a nano-story. Advance yourself with the ample of use of alternative adjectives ‚Äî and the apt alliteration from time to time. You don't need to use "really, really" and "very, very" all the time, after all. You have a gargantuan library of word choices; far more than just those few (only two!) If you're prone to thinking outside the box while speaking on the fly, add a parenthetical (but not too often, lest you throw your audience off track). Try out a chiasmus once in a while; few figures of speech trigger a tingle in the ears as much as a lofty, "Crayons are used by creatives ardently, and it is ardent creatives who use crayons."</p><p>Start each speech with a clean, dry, canvas. Collect your thoughts, open a thesaurus, draw some lines, then color in the shapes you've created. Your audience's ear will appreciate it with a fervor.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/crayons-colors-school-drawing-879974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pixabay.com/photos/crayons-colors-school-drawing-879974/</a></li><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Two answers (both of which you know):]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two answers (both of which you know):</p><p>1) It depends and 2) as long as it needs to be, but no longer.</p><p>So how do you figure out how long is long enough?</p><p>The other night I evaluated a 4-5 minute speech; the speaker was concerned that a quote she was planning on using would make the speech too long, so I told her to excluded it, and she did. And the speech was <em>still</em> too long. Yes, she managed to fit it into the 4-5 minute window, but she rushed her way through the content, speaking far too quickly than would be comfortable for the audience.</p><p>So we conflate fast talking and speech times, but the two are intertwined. If we want to shorten a speech, we think we can just speed up our speaking and that'll do the trick; but it doesn't. It's too much content too fast. So speed is one element; get your voice down to a comfortable, conversational pace. Leave time for your voice to be heard, and the idea to absorbed. Pause a lot.</p><p>The notion of making a speech conversational also is a good guide to how long you should make it. Be candid with yourself. How long would you want to listen to your topic, without a break? How would you share the idea with someone you were going to spend an hour over coffee with? You'd probably share it in fragments, right? Make point, get a response. Make another point, check to see if they understand.</p><p>You can do the same with on-stage speeches, too. No matter how big the topic is, human nature will dictate that your audience will get restless at around fifteen minutes. Imagine yourself, again, at coffee with someone who doesn't stop talking? Fifteen minutes will seem like forever!</p><p>So keep it short. Really, short. Shorter than you feel comfortable with. <em>Much</em> shorter. Compress the most cognizant points into the first fifteen minutes. If you have time allocated to speak longer, say an hour instead, use the rest of that time to find ways to directly engage the audience. Take them on a guided tour of your idea, rather than have them passive listeners.</p><p>So there you have it. Fifteen minutes or shorter and only, <em>only</em>, if you're speaking a normal conversational pace. Use the remaining time (forty five minutes) as an exercise in creativity. Prepare questions ahead of time. Create follow up slides and "sub-speeches" on the topic and interject as need. But let the audience have fun for the remainder of the time. That's how long a speech should be: long enough that the audience only has time for fun.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Richard Branson is quoted:]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Branson is quoted:</p><blockquote class="inlinequote"><p>Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients.</p><cite>‚Äî Richard Branson</cite></blockquote><p> I like this people-centric point of view. You can argue which is more important, clients, customers, vendors, employees, shareholders, management, the sales team (which in some companies I've worked for, the sales team seemed like they were treated as most important!), but the overall gist of Branson's quote is that company leadership needs to take care of employees, and from there, a positive cascade effect will occur for the clients and company alike.</p><p>I'd add, <em>you can best take care of employees if you take care of the systems they use.</em></p><p>I hate to break it to you, but your employees are all massively flawed. You are too, and the lot of you share a common attribute: you're human. The beauty of being human though is that we can create a set of organized principles to share with each other and, if we agree on said principles, follow them to the great benefit of the whole. The whole, in this case, being the company.</p><p>Yet I find companies might go through the gargantuan effort of setting up the 'biggest, baddest, most efficient' system on the planet, only to let entropy and human nature erode its original purpose and the principles behind it. Managers let their systems age without regular checkups ‚Äî which is not unlike what many humans do. The health of those systems, be it a project management tool, a budgeting spreadsheet, instant messaging software, safety protocols, inventory management, continuous integration (and countless more), is directly correlated to the 'job health' of the employees.</p><p>Your employees are hired and trained on your organization's systems. If the system is found wanting and degrades, so does the productivity of your employees, as they try to use workarounds or revert to undesirable habits, or in particularly bad cases, leverage poisonous incentives. And by Richard Branson's logic, your clients will also suffer as the services or products they expect from you also degrade in quality.</p><p>And it will happen. <em>No</em> system can resist the entropic force of human nature; but <em>every</em> system can leverage human ingenuity and community, and the desire to do well for one's self, one's peers, and the organization's customers. Regular upkeep has to be a habit. An organizational habit.</p><p>Yes, take care of your employees first. A big part of that is to make sure that their tools are functional and well maintained! </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7356284-clients-do-not-come-first-employees-come-first-if-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7356284-clients-do-not-come-first-employees-come-first-if-you</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all like to be acknowledged for the work we do; for the effort we put into something; and sometimes just for the sake of being human. We all have challenges to overcome. And this is true for both speech makers and meeting takers.</p><p>So how does one give kudos to another, in an environment where most all of the focus is on you, and not the other person to be recognized?</p><p>With precise humility. Precise humility? Yes, <em>precise </em>humility. Look, being humble can sometimes be a bit of a fiasco; some days you think you're being humble, but others around you think you're just doing it to take on the appearance, but not the reality, of humility. On other days, you're giving out kudos left and right and the very people you're trying to recognize just aren't buying it. Sometimes, despite all your efforts of being a good person, people are ready to accept another's offerin of humility or of recognition.</p><p>So in a meeting (or on stage), you have to be very clear about <em>why</em> you're passing on a recognition <em>and</em> it has to be related to the topic at hand. You have to satisfy both conditions. You can't just say "Let's give a hand to Barbara for having the most sales revenue" in a meeting that is about user interface design. It's incongruent. If you're in a sales meeting, you're going to need have a good 'why' to attach to that. It's great that Barbara is meeting her numbers, even beating out the others on her team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, you're not alone on stage.</p><p>"Great! The other person can do all of the work," you think. Not so fast, Slick. You've gotta shoulder some of that responsibility. If you want your pitch, your presentation, your partner to be successful, you have to participate as well. </p><p>While being alone on stage imparts focus and attention from the audience more so than multiple would, having a pair of people on stage can be highly effective in getting your point across. But it only works well if you back each other up. Having another person on stage doing essentially nothing is a distraction. Don't be the distraction!</p><p>One key to success in business is collaboration. This is especially true on the stage, when you and a partner are working together to present. Presenting as a pair is not much different than presenting alone; all of the same components apply:</p><ul><li>Write, Rehearse and Repeat. Together. Practicing together is essential.</li><li>You still need Logos, Pathos, and Ethos to make the speech work. Having two people on stage doesn't make you more credible; it just means you have twice the opportunity to prove yourselves</li><li>Body language and timing become more important than ever before; you have to be able to hand off topics in way that is clear to the audience. An improper segue can lose you audience's attention very easily.</li></ul><p>Partnering with someone on a presentation can be very gratifying. You get to share your ideas with another person who is aligned with you and you also can get a different take on your shared topic. It can make getting on stage a little less anxiety inducing for many people, but that does not mean you can simply delegate all the effort onto to the other person.</p><p>Partnerships take practice, but double the potential.</p><p> </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>An entry on the more corporate/legal side of partnerships: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a conversation with a successful entrepreneur buddy of mine, he offered an interesting (to me) perspective to take with regards to making forward motion your life. His premise is that most people tend to look for work that "suits their current needs or personalities." This is wrong, according to my friend. Rather, a person should adapt his or her ideas looking for a job that will suit their future needs.</p><p>This isn't a particularly new idea; Dan Gilbert talks about it in his book "Stumbling on Happiness" (which I have not read, but have seen his TED talk that has similar content). What I think I like about my friend's perspective is that it's just skewed enough away from my current thinking that it got me thinking more.</p><p>If we stick with the "looking for a job based on current personality," what we're really doing is anchoring ourselves to our past personality ‚Äî you know, the one that would rather binge watch TV than writing the next great screenplay? ‚Äî and in doing so, we're limiting ourselves. What we should do instead is project our personality from the present into the future, and ask something like, "What would my personality need to be like in order to succeed at this particular job?" and "How do I adapt from where I am to where I would like to be?"</p><p>I think what really stands out about my friend's perspective is much more basic than the philosophy and psychology of happiness. Rather, it's a reminder that simply talking to other people with an open mind and an ear towards listening can offer new, even if tiny insights. And each insight is a stepping stone into the future, rather than reflection of the past. </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/18/daniel-gilbert-happiness-future-self/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/18/daniel-gilbert-happiness-future-self/</a></li><li>https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400077427</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Overheard at a coffee shop, regarding a final presentation for a college communications class:</p><blockquote>"Three of us were accountants, but the fourth was a geo-engineer. We all wore business casual, but he wore sneakers and a t-shirt and a backwards baseball cap that he <em>refused to take off </em>[emphasis from speaker]."</blockquote><p>Wow. It's not so much that they disagreed on the mode of dress; what makes this a bad situation is that the forth fellow refused to even accommodate for the situation. Granted, this was a college class (and it sounds like they passed), but what would have happened if the presentation was "for real?"</p><p>It'd go badly, I think you can image. Again, not so much the style of dress is the problem, but rather the inconsistency between the entrepreneurs. If they can't manage to act like a team during a pitch, how much of a team will they be when the business ramps up to full speed?</p><p>Take a moment to reflect on past team experiences ‚Äî heck, even personal experiences. Have you let your attitude get in the way? Have you let a minor stubborn tick lead you to go against the grain of the moment? Yes, going against the grain is the way to go when you're committed and have a fantastic idea to pitch to the world, but refusing to remove your hat to support the rest of the team's pitch? That's just unreasonable.</p><p>Suit up, hat off ‚Äî if that's what is going to win the pitch.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my almost twenty years in the mobile and semi-conductor industry, I've never stood around and chatted with co-workers around the watercooler. Either the business I was in simply didn't have water coolers to stand around, or there the water cooler was just located in the most inconvenient of places, like next to the boss's office. So no standing around for me.</p><p>Metaphorically, speaking I did indeed spend a lot of time standing around the water cooler chatting with my co-workers. Odd as it may sound, I learned a lot about how conversational styles, both good and bad, in such water cooler scenarios ‚Äî hallways, kitchenettes, cubicals, empty meeting rooms and the odd actual water-cooler.</p><p>Water cooler chit-chat can be fun. It's part personal, part business, and generally speaking, a relaxing break from the doldrums of daily deliberations. But what happens when water cooler talk goes wrong?</p><p>Sometimes, as much as you like your co-workers, certain topics are either off limits because of politics, religion, or other types of content; boring, because you have don't relate to what they say; or the timing is just bad ‚Äî you have to get back to your desk or off the next meetings.</p><p>And yet they won't stop talking. How do you get out of that?</p><p>It's easy enough to say, hard to enact. We're culturally ingrained to think that "politeness" means not interrupting. But that's a false notion; it takes two people to be in the conversation and if one side of the conversation isn't getting the verbal or physical cues that you'd like to end the chat organically, then they are actually being the rude ones (not on purpose, mind you; people just like to be heard, and you're a great listener!)</p><p>To break out of a conversation lock, try this:</p><ol><li>Reach your hand out, palm down, to about belly-button height right in between you and the other person. This is the prompt that you want to say something. If they don't look down readily enough, escalate by reaching up to gentle touch their shoulders.</li><li>As do so, say their name, followed by "I'd really like to continue this, but have a meeting to go to." Or whatever manages for the truth at the moment ‚Äî such as "I have to get back to work." For example, "Bob, I'd really like to continue this chat, but I have a meeting to go to."</li></ol><p>About 80% of the time, this will work flawlessly. No one gets offended; most people are very understanding, and realize how much time can get lost in lively banter. What about the remaining 20% of the time, when the don't pick up the first time? Try their name twice in a row, with slight emphasis on the second one: "Bob... BOB..." (and still keep the hand gesture in there). Using their name is important. We respond to our names in a way we don't respond other words, like "hey," or "look," or especially "um." You'll have to be a little bold sometimes. But don't feel like you're being rude! You've got important things to do, as does Bob. It's work, not play, that you're at.</p><p>The war around the water cooler is mild, but sometimes you have to take drastic action to win it.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cooler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cooler</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At whatever age you learn to ride a bike (if you have done so), it's safe to say it's no easy task, at least initially. When you're young, you're own body and pressure from parents and peers gets in the way just as much as learning how a bicycle work does; and when you're older, habits and attitude can be just as inhibiting.</p><p>Yet, once a you pass some magic threshold, it's as if you've always known how to ride. Sure, you're not an expert; you're not going to be doing stunts and you'll stumble here and there, but the hard part is done and a "naturalness" replaces most of the struggles. Why is that? And how does it apply to public speaking?</p><p> "Motor Learning" is the key to a person's success in riding a bike. It's less habit and more... ingrained physicality. From the wikipedia article on the topic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning</a>):</p><p><em>"It often involves improving the smoothness and accuracy of movements and is obviously necessary for complicated movements such as speaking, playing the piano, and climbing trees."</em></p><p> </p><p> The same thing applies to public speaking as well. Practice does approach perfection. But I want to take this a step further; good public speaking is more than just words coming out of your mouth. It's also gestures and gesticulation, body movement and physical presence. Riding a bike involves a significant amount of body interaction; this muscle memory portion of motor learning is what makes cycling so intuitive after awhile.</p><p>You can make public speaking as intuitive by adding in body language components to your speeches, deliberately. Common, culturally shared patterns such as spreading your hands apart to represent growth or large size, not only engage your audience, but they also help you embody your speaking habits more readily. Not unlike riding a bike.</p><p>A stereotype of many public speakers is the dry professor standing behind a lectern, barley raising a finger. That professor would be a lot better off teaching class having applied the same basics of bike riding to speaking. Take advantage of motor learning!</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>An amazing and fun video that demonstrates how habit and muscle memory work in riding a bike (from Smarter Every Day): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid, I was terminally shy. The concept of eye contact was as terrifying as jumping off a bridge. The sensation of the hair raising on my back each time I'd even glance someone's way was a clear sign of being in a flight response. If I didn't know you, I probably barely would look you in the eye.</p><p>Thankfully, partly through the miracle of puberty and then practice through college, I had far less trouble making eye contact with folks; came to understand the cultural norms regarding it as well, just so I didn't overshoot any tender boundaries.</p><p>What I've noticed over the years in networking and business meetings is almost an inverse problem that I had ‚Äî people are <em>too</em> focused on eye contact. Not in a creepy way, but in an exclusitory way. </p><p>When your engaged in a circle of folks at a networking event or around a table in a meeting room, make sure that you engage with <em>everyone. </em>If you're speaking, look not only at the main target of your comments, but also glance around at the other folks, giving them at least a micro-second of empathic connection with your eyes. What I often observe is that the speaker of the moment cannot take their eyes off one person, almost forgetting other people are around them.</p><p>This is what I mean by eye contact being used in a exclusionary way. Instead, by at least scanning the other observers you become inclusionary. The benefits are:</p><ol><li>You can see the state of your listeners; are you boring them? Exciting them? Their micro-expressions will tell you legions.</li><li>You give yourself a bit of break from staring at the same person; likewise, you give the person your staring at a break and an reason for them too to look at the other folks.</li><li>When you return to your main focus, you can given them the opportunity to respond back. Glancing around is a great "pre-check" that your point has been made, and then you are handing over the baton for another person to take.</li></ol><p>That's inclusion through eye contact. So watch yourself next time you're in a meeting. Keep a conscious tally of how often you look around at the other folks in the space. Let them feel involved. Even if they are a shy as I was as a kid, and don't say anything at all, they'll be glad when your give them a friendly look.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>[NSFW] Mark Mason is a self-development guru who focuses on the dating scene.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine how you feel when you walk into someone home (hopefully your own!) and smell the comforting and warm scent of chocolate chip cookies, and apple pie, or cinnamon buns. Right away, you know what's coming. Deliciousness!</p><p>You don't have to see the cookies to know they are ready to eat. You know way ahead of time. In speech making, you'll want to do the same for audience. Provide a 'scent' that will stick with the crowd, an odor that will heighten anticipation and delight when expectations are fulfilled.</p><p>The metaphor of the scent is another way of looking at foreshadowing or the concept of 'begin with the end in mind.' As you write your speech, keep in mind what the point is that you are providing the listeners. Scent the proverbial air with puffs of ideas and concepts. For example, a leading question that you will answer later, such as "How many woodchucks can a woodchuck chuck?" ‚Äî then dive into facts about woodchucks before actually answering the question (and as far as scents go, I'm not sure woodchucks are idea animals to pleasant sensations). </p><p>Keep that in mind whenever you're writing a speech. Like notes from a piano, like foreshadowing in a book, leading your audience to where you want to go will help make your talk more memorable and fun.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>Though this has nothing to do with public speaking, I was reminded of the idea after I saw this link: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Sweaty palms all day, every day. But the effort taught me something. Humor is okay. In fact, humor in business is awesome.</p><p>I've always been one of those people (not uncommon) who tries to break up tense situations with a joke or a funny aside here and there. It took awhile, but during my trainings I realized two things: 1) Being humorous relaxed me (if only a tiny bit) and 2) the audience seemed to be more engaged and retain more information (if my end-of-training polls were to be believed). So I kept it up. Those first few years of being in the "corporate public," as it were, did a lot to improve my confidence.</p><p>But a place that took me much longer to gain confidence in was meetings. Face-to-face, we've-got-business-to-discuss type meetings. Large accounts, small accounts, vendors, clients, customers, internal, external. Nerve-f'n'-wracking.</p><p>It's not like I didn't know my stuff. I was just fearful and confident that my confidence would show through. Ground zero of imposter syndrome. </p><p>But I watched. I listened. I recalled how humor helped me in presentations. I started to apply it here and there. And I started to mimic, a little, with my own style, people who I respected who seemed to be able to inject humor at anytime, even when the situation was dark.</p><p>Take Ben, a sysadmin who I admired greatly. Gregarious, smart, open-minded and caring. We'd often be on phone meetings together, and he'd slip in the funniest little things. A self deprecating joke here. A ironic observation there. He'd ask about people's family (which isn't funny, per se, but he'd often open up a meeting with a funny story about his own family, then crack a joke about his wife painted his toenails for him so she could relax). Over time, what I came to realize was that being open and humorous was okay. </p><p>Business is business, but humans are humans, and good rapport trumps all challenges. Rapport created through openness, listening, and humor.</p><p>It took more formal training and research into public speaking to move beyond the silly jokes and ad libs I'd put into my earliest training presentations. It took listening to people like Ben and how folks responded to me to be okay with experimenting to move beyond my massive shyness and overly serious nature (in the business world). The combination of the two, public speaking training and observation, for me learn how to be more comfortable in my own skin, more comfortable with other people (even in serious situations) and to express myself in a positive way that created connectedness, and through connectedness, effectiveness.</p><p>The moral of this story is clear: Humor has a place in meetings. Humor is a human activity. Humor is fun, even when business is serious. </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first "real" job in tech was with a local internet service provider, or ISP. This was just when the ubiquity of the Web was not quite there and AOL had their marketing campaign to drown everyone in compact discs with their AOL Onlne platform.</p><p>I worked there for less than a year. A coworker of mine mentioned that Qualcomm, a massive tech company (and even bigger nowadays) was hiring for a much better hour salary. Trying to keep some sense of loyalty to the current company I was at, I gave notice and took the time to have a meeting with my boss so I could tell him what was up.</p><p>That meeting did not go well.</p><p>The quick of it was that I put my foot in my mouth at one point. I brought up a personal point of why I wanted a pay raise and health benefits, two things that I would have gotten going to Qualcomm. He refused ‚Äî and then indelicately pointed out that "bringing up personal issues was a 'no-no'" in the work environment (to paraphrase). This was the first time I'd ever attempted to negotiate the conditions of my job. My boss was, unsurprisingly, much more experienced in these matters so I thought, and his response and attitude hit me hard. I thought I'd screwed up badly. I cared (too much) about his opinion. </p><p>I also rejected the "opportunity" to stay in my current position and took the new job at Qualcomm.</p><p>It took a long while to realize I was not at fault, not bad, nor made some life-shattering mistake. Rather, I was young, naive, wanting to try something new, and eager to get a pay-raise. I had taken my bosses comments too personally at the time ‚Äî and as part of that, my fear of interviews was unduly exaggerated for years.</p><p>I got over it, eventually.</p><p>Learning public speaking skills was a big help in overcoming that bias, that fear. To really grow in public speaking (and really, in life in general), it helps to get candid and safe feedback. It helps to hear from others, people who observe and critique, but do not judge. Friends. These evaluations not only help improve one's speaking skills, but they also demonstrate that one does not need to take things personally and that being relaxed and open to suggestions can be a normal state of mind.</p><p>After many years of "hardening" myself (yet, still be soft and accepting), I put interviews in a new light. I was far more casual about my approach. I was a better listener to the interviewer. I learned how to ask questions that were better oriented towards mutual benefit. And importantly, if I was dealing with someone I felt was hostile or simply not engaged with me, I didn't take it personally. I objectively listened to their words politely and if I didn't think there was a fit, I'd let them know and exit the interview myself.</p><p>That was the power of my public speaking training. The ability to approach interviews with a casualness I'd never known before, yet still be serious.</p><p>The exit interview I had leaving that ISP deeply colored my outlook towards business ‚Äî it was the nail on the coffin of what was not the most positive way to start my career (though I am grateful for the experience and my awesome co-workers and reports the short time I was there) ‚Äî but partly through public speaking training (which started in Qualcomm, by the way), I at least managed to change both my approach and my attitude, adding much to my later success in my subsequent career.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been asked to setup a meeting? How do you arrange the invite and who do you include? How do you prepare and execute? Are you giving the presentation?</p><p>Look, we've all been there ‚Äî the meeting that never seems to end, all the speakers tend to ramble, where the next scheduled group is impatiently knocking on the little glass window in the door, and worst of all, you have no idea what was supposed to happen. When you exit such a meeting, what runs through your mind? I'll bet it's something like, "next time Bob sends me a meeting a request, I'm going to ignore it." </p><p>Yeah, probably a good idea. </p><p>I've always been flabbergasted by seemingly pointless meetings, having been invited to a voluminous number of them. As far as I tell, historically speaking, most corporate meetings just stem form bad habits. Meetings are trope, a tradition, that has been handed down from when the industrial revolution was in full swing and people wanted to look important to their bosses.</p><p>They wanted to demonstrate credibility.</p><p>That was then. This is now. We're busier than ever trying to get our jobs done, and the last thing we need is someone sending requests that needlessly fill up our calendars. "Bob," wants to make an impression. Or maybe he literally doesn't know what to do next, and he's looking for input. He'll invite everyone! Hopefully, someone will show up to say something profound, letting Bob know what path to take. </p><p>Sorry, Bob. That's not a way to build credibility. It's not the 19th or 20th century anymore. You can impress your boss in far better ways ‚Äî like by holding fewer meetings. And of those that you do out on the calendar, Bob, make sure you have an agenda, an expected outcome, and give a heads up in advance to each and every attendee why they are needed in <em>this</em> particular meeting.</p><p>You'll be more productive, your co-workers will be more productive, and your credibility will skyrocket. </p><p>Especially if you bring donuts üç©<sup>*</sup>.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>(* Please, don't bring donuts.

            <description><![CDATA[Rhetoric.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rhetoric. </p><p>Such a dirty word. It conjures up of pencil mustachioed villains; side-show hustlers, cigar crunching, baby kissing politicians; well groomed business suit bosses; old white-haired Greeks in togas from ancient history; fire and brimstone preachers; and many, more negative images, all of whom leave a bad taste of people who manipulate others, their audiences, into working against their own best interest, and all in favor of the person on the podium.</p><p>People who are rhetorically skillful seem like swindling magicians, able to lie, conive and manipulate our words and thoughts with mere linguistic gymnastics.</p><p>It's time to claim the word Rhetoric back for the people!</p><p>This NPR article: <a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/rhetoric-postive-negative-or-both," target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.michiganradio.org/post/rhetoric-postive-negative-or-both,</a> provides a less flamboyant, but still negatively biased historical perspective, saying:</p><p>"'By the 17th century, we start to see some use where people are using ‚Äòrhetoric‚Äô to talk about sort of overblown speech, speech that is big words, but maybe not backed up...from there it gets more and more negative, and I think now you‚Äôll hear people use it to talk about words that seem empty to them. It‚Äôs just rhetoric,' explains [Anne] Curzan [Professor of English at the University of Michigan]"</p><p>Rhetoric, by itself, is just a word. As a concept, it's a social <em>tool</em>, a tool that can be use for good or for evil. It's a word that's been demonized by association because we, as humans, tend to keep negative experiences in our heads much more readily than positive ones. No one goes around thinking, "Wow, that Tony Robbins just performed some amazing rhetorical action; I feel jazzed to get out and do something awesome!"</p><p>You don't think that. If you hear Tony Robbins, you go straight to being jazzed up. You don't give it any conscious thought that he, too, like all inspirational speakers, just manipulated your attitude. With rhetoric.</p><p>Rhetoric is not unique to charismatics like Tony Robbins, or Zig Ziglar, or John F. Kennedy. It's built <em>into</em> you, as a social creature. You can only be persuaded by rhetoric if you're biologically and linguistically inclined to being persuaded. On the flip side, that means <em>you</em> too can be persuasive. You too can be a slick talker. You too can be witty.</p><p>And I think it's important that <em>all</em> of us gain proficiency in this skill. Why? Because by learning how and why you are persuaded, and how and why you would persuade others, you become more mentally alert and nimble and more open minded. You fear less. And when two rhetoricians with good intent and integrity argue or negotiate, <em>shit gets done. </em>And it gets done to the benefit of all.</p><p>Rhetoric is not a word just to describe sleazebag talkers. It's a powerful skill that we all need to learn so that sleazebag talkers can no longer take advantage of us, and to top it off, we can all communicate more fluidly and positively with each other. </p><p>Let's work to have a return to the rhetoric of Aristotle's time. Just with a little more diversity than a bunch of old, white, Ancient Greeks. </p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric</a></li><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not uncommon for a presenter, be it someone in a meeting, or a toastmaster, or a master of ceremonies to use the phrase, "So without further ado..." to transition between sections of an event.<br><br>It's a bit an overused trope, don't you think? It's also a bit lazy, but I get it. It a clause that sounds just sophisticated enough that we, as speakers, hope that the audience will value us a little bit more. Or, probably more often, we do it because we're uncomfortable making transitions between slides or portions of a meeting and the commonplace nature of the idiom is, well, comfortable.</p><p>So what can you do to replace it with something more original and without feeling too awkward?</p><p>I suspect most people use the clause for the simple reason of it being a socially acceptable shortcut. Our brains require little brain power to pull it up, get it out, and convey a lot of meaning to our audience. That's what we do as humans.</p><p>Consider instead starting with a Pause (with a capital P!). Let the drama build just for a moment, then say, "Moving on...," or "In the next portion of our meeting," or "I'm excited to get going/move on...." The Pause is a key element to making this work. It establishes a break for the audience and takes advantage of a minor flaw in our psychology... we forget things particularly quickly.</p><p>Yup. In that brief moment of you taking a breath (and perhaps scanning the crowd), the part of an audience member's brain that was taking in what you just said, file it away (perhaps to be lost forever, but hopefully not) and because you've Paused... their brains will be waiting for a context switch or additional information (obviously, you're delivering a context switch). You deliver such a switch, and voila, the audience's subconscious expectations are fulfilled. They've already "forgotten" that you've just done the introduction.</p><p>I guarantee, with practice, such a transition will not be awkward. Give a it a try next time; try out something new! Sometimes, you can take context for the transition clause from your audience or what you know is coming up next. For example, if I'm about to introduce a new speaker, after initial introductions, I'll mention how excited I am to hear what they have to say. </p><p>(Pro-tip: Most of the time, you'll know that their will be a transition coming up - prepare for it when you're organizing the event or working on your slide deck. Don't let an opportunity to shine uniquely pass you by).</p><p>Let go of ado. Embrace the new.</p><p>Adieu!</p><hr><p>p.s.</p><p>For fun, here's a link with some historical context for "So without further ado..."</p><ul><li><a href="https://grammarist.com/phrase/without-further-ado-vs-without-further-adieu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://grammarist.com/phrase/without-further-ado-vs-without-further-adieu/</a></li></ul><p>And for formality's sake, the wiktionary link:</p><ul><li>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/with_no_further_ado</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We <em>all</em> get nervous when we get on stage. As Mark Twain put it:</p><blockquote class="inlinequote"><p>There are two types of speakers: Those who get nervous and those who are liars.</p></blockquote><p><cite>‚ÄîMark Twain (attributed)</cite></p><p>But some folks ‚Äî okay, <em>most </em>folks ‚Äî get it in their head that they have to provide a pitch perfect performance. This expectation causes even deeper anxiety and in turn, the butterflies take on monstrous proportions. It doesn't need to be that way.</p><p>The problem, as I see it, is in the word "performance." For those of us, myself included, who aren't trained in the classical arts, performing can seem unnatural and downright intimidating. On top of that, we often get the feeling we're being disingenuous. After all, isn't performing taking on the guise of someone else?</p><p>Not at all! We perform every day. Consider how you act (see that word?!) in front of say, your mother, as opposed to your boss. Social conventions require us to adapt our own internal thermostats to deal with the current social circumstances. Old college buddies? Curse like a sailor. Meeting your significant other's parents? Less cursing, more politeness.</p><p>Regardless, you're <em>always</em> performing. It's just that being on stage means your performing for lots of folks; this does not diminish the fact that it is a different social situation that you need to adapt to. So adapt away!</p><p>Performance is not the same as theatrical acting. Performance in public speaking is the act of being deliberate and concentrated in your delivery in such a way that it fits the needs and expectations of your audience. Keep that in mind and maybe the roar of the butterflies will calm down. Best of luck!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I attended a TEDx conference in Portland, OR. There were a number of inspirational and interesting speakers, but I came away from it more upset than inspired. Many people did, as it turns out. As I walked out of the auditorium after the last speaker, I heard many mumblings about how cranky people were and how their expectations were not met.</p><p>All because of <em>one </em>person: the very first speaker.</p><p>Here's the deal. If you're asked to speak at a conference, remember this little rule: <em>it's not all about you.</em></p><p>The first speaker of this TEDx talk took the entire time speaking about himself. Whereas most TED talks are around 15 minutes, he took a 25 minutes to complete his rambling monologue. The result? The next speaker didn't have enough time to complete her speech, nor did the one after nor the one after that, until cumulatively, an entire speech had to be removed from the agenda <em>and </em>lunch was late.</p><p>To be fair, this first speaker wasn't the only one responsible. A couple of the other speakers went over their time, compounding the issue. And to make matters worse, it seems to me the organizers didn't seem particularly well organized (lunch service was a bit of mess, along with simply being late); they should have emphasized emphatically to the subsequent speakers to try and be at least on time, if not a little under time.</p><p>All that said, creating any sort of event, but especially one such as a TEDx conference is hard work, requiring many people to coordinate and collaborate for many months to make the event successful. As a speaker, you may be on stage, but you're not necessarily the center of attention ‚Äî the audience is. Never forget that. The audience is there to learn and to have fun and to experience something wondrous. Give them that gift; don't go over time, don't talk about yourself, and respect the time of all the other speakers and the organizers. All of these people came together to make magic happen. Respect that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Daniel Pink's book, <em>To Sell is Human </em>(Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Moving-Others-ebook/dp/B0087GJ8KM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Moving-Others-ebook/dp/B0087GJ8KM</a>), he writes about the ABC's of moving people; that is, how to persuade and sell to other folks. His ABC's are:</p><ul><li><strong>A</strong>: Attunement - Getting aligned with another's perspective.</li><li><strong>B</strong>: Buoyancy - Handling rejection.</li><li><strong>C</strong>: Clarity - Making sense of the situation.</li></ul><p>I think Pink's ABC's are worth adding as tools to the public speaking arena. Aside from the obvious connection between "selling" and being on stage persuading, these ideas fill in some spaces that the three modes, Credibility, Empathy, and Reason miss out on. </p><p>Attunement and Empathy are practically synonyms; still, as a speaker, one must remember to keep aligned with audience, so Attunement is a powerful reminders. Buoyancy reminds us that even on stage, there's a remote chance of rejection by the audience; what form that takes will vary. The important point is that if a speaker was somehow disconnected from the shared reality of the audience, the speaker shouldn't take it personal. Rather, the speaker should <em>learn</em> from such events, and improve on the next performance. And lastly, Clarity: this one applies to so many levels of public speaking: during research, figuring out how to distill the core message; during delivery, making sure to present the evidence or ideas in a reasonable way; and even after a speech, getting clear feedback on how the speech went. All important elements for growth.</p><p>Pink's ABC's: Something to remember when you develop your next speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep this mind when giving a presentation or speech: <em><strong>tis far better to agitate than to irritate</strong>.</em></p><p>Per Google, <em><strong>agitate</strong> </em>is defined as:</p><p><strong><em>verb: </em>to campaign to arouse public concern about an issue in the hope of prompting action.</strong></p><p>and <em><strong>irritate</strong> </em>is defined as:</p><p><strong><em>verb: </em>to make (someone) annoyed, impatient, or angry.</strong></p><p>We often conflate the two words; indeed one possible definition of agitation is "to make nervous" ‚Äî but being nervous is far different from being made angry.</p><p>So when you prepare your next passionate, inspiring, speech make your intentions are clear. Do you want to agitate your audience to action? Or irritate them to annoyance?</p><p>The results can be quite different.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I visited the District 55, Division J International Speech contest for Toastmasters, here in Austin, Texas. Toastmasters regularly holds these contests and it's a great way to see some fantastic speakers, one of whom might win the final contest held this summer in Colorado. </p><p>The winner of today's contest gave a stirring speech about her brother, and intelligent, fun loving fellow with some quirky ideas on life (at least to some people!). The final part of her story was the revelation that her brother was dying; she had come to take him to the hospital, something he refused to do for himself, but after some time, conversation, and reflection, decided to respect his opinion on the matter. She wanted to respect who he was as a person. It was touching and very personal; in my opinion, easily the best speech out of the five that were presented.</p><p>Afterward the contest, when everyone was congratulating the winner, a well respected officer in Toastmaster offered this piece of advice to the winner: "Add a take way to the end. Something the audience can hold onto."</p><p>I agreed with her and rephrased it as, "Put a bow on the gift that is your speech." What the speaker failed to do, despite an otherwise wonderful delivery, was to connect to the story of her brother to the values and concerns of the audience. While the speech was a heartfelt discussion about a concerned sister and her ailing brother, what lesson did she learn that should could have imparted up on us? A listener might have implied a moral such as, "to each their own," but was that what she meant? I wasn't sure, and since another person had mentioned it as well, I was sure many more of us were left curious.</p><p>The idea of offering something tangible, a moral, a call to action, to the audience is critical in removing any sort of ambiguity about what the speech was meant to convey. When you're delivering your speeches, think of your speech as a gift. The structure is the box, the words the wrapping, and the story the content. To make that gift just <em>that</em> much more special, make sure to put a bow on it. A bow that is a call to action for your audience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is public speaking? Most people arguably would qualify public speaking as a performance of sorts not unlike being on stage for a play or in a movie. A speaker has a prepared dialog and is delivering it to a audience who, generally, do not interact with the "performer."</p><p>And rightly so that we should think of public speaking in the light of being a performance. But public speaking is also a conversation, and when a speaker approaches it as such, public speaking takes on a new light.</p><p>I look at conversation as a sort of dance ‚Äî the two (or more) participants naturally flow back and forth in a fluid manner. There is structure, but it malleable and changes based on trending of the current topic. Will we stay talking about the weather? Or will we move to a more serious or personal concern? In an empathetic conversation, each person listens to the other and speaks to both acknowledge the other while also offering opinions, ideas, thoughts, and feelings.</p><p>This notion of empathic conversation is how we should also approach public speaking. Yes, there are many times when the audience does not directly reflect back what the speaker is saying ‚Äî to wit, the audience doesn't even directly participate. But if you, as a speaker, approach your style from a conversational point of view, a few magical things can happen. You are more natural in your delivery. Your audience feels connected with you (and hopefully your message!). You can read and adapt to your audience's mood in a better fashion. And for those of you who are especially nervous about getting on stage, taking the point of view that you are conversing, rather than performing, can often settle the butterflies.</p><p>So next time you're on state, consider your approach to be more of a conversation, and less of a performance.</p><p>(But don't forget, you <em>still</em> are performing!)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the classic tips of public speaking is "know thy audience." There's a lot of good from proactively understanding who you will be presenting to. Great tip to have! But I wouldn't include it in my top 10 public speaking tips.</p><p>Why not? </p><p>While I think "know thy audience" is a cornerstone idea of good public speaking, I think highlighting as primary learning point puts too much pressure on the speaker-to-be. What does "know" really mean? Every audience is different. And on top of that, I find people often get caught up in making their speech "perfect" of a perceived type of audience. Speakers get trapped in the web of their ego, thinking they <em>have</em> to get point A or idea B across, because that's what the audience (they think) actually wants.</p><p>But do they? </p><p>Instead, I like to have people understand their audience implicitly. Humanely. Egolessly. When a speaker considers own credibility relative to the audience, and through keeping an empathetic mindset towards their audience (all audiences, really), "know thy audience" takes on a more approachable candor. Ego is taken out of the equation and the speaker can step up on stage with more self-assuredness and a better connection to the audience.</p><p>Definitely take the time to know your audience. Just don't let your ego get in the way of doing so!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, an acquaintance of mine gave a statement of thanks and gratitude at the end of a networking event we were both attending. I spoke with him after, and he said he was "nervous" and "shaking" and this his voice was "warbling," and made many other comments about how poorly he did.</p><p>He did fine. Excellent, even, considering the applause that came from the group (and my own opinion!). Yet, he was still mildly dismissive of my "good job!" congratulations.</p><p>I see this all the time ‚Äî and often did it myself ‚Äî and it hits me that maybe (for some people) the problem with getting on stage is less the fear of embarrassing ourselves in front of each other than it is embarrassing ourselves ‚Äî in front of <em>ourselves.</em></p><p>It's a bias we have that we think we need to be perfect when public speaking, but the reality is that, as in all things, we don't need to be perfect. And that's the crux of the matter. For first time speakers, you don't need to be perfect.</p><p>The audience <em>will</em> support you and <em>will not</em> noticed a vast majority of your faux pas' that, to you, are brighter than the sun. And even if they do notice, they will forgive you.</p><p>So that's out of the way (he said, sarcastically).</p><p>Your past self will also forgive you for any slights you made. But unlike your audience, you past self has far grander expectations for you than the audience does. Far, far grander. Expectations of speaking that no human could ever hope to live up to. You're bound to "fail" when making such comparisons. Little wonder we're afraid when our past self is setting us up for not meeting its expectations.</p><p>But you won't "fail." You <em>might</em> stumble or stutter. Or you might not. If you focus on the bad outcomes; if you focus on the impossible roadmap your past self has laid in front of you, yes, you'll get misdirected. So leave your imagination behind. Focus instead, for the time you are a beginner, on a friendly face in the audience. Just one or two. The audience is far less a critic of you than you think.</p><p>There's one caveat to all of this inspirational re-direction of your thoughts. You can delude yourself to thinking you're great at public speaking, when in fact you aren't It's the obverse of the coin of public speaking fear: being overconfident or even laissez-faire. But the solution is easy: Be authentic at all times. Keep learning. Keep practicing. Keep yourself open to helpful evaluations and adapt your style, over and over again.</p><p>You don't need to be perfect to prove yourself to yourself. You just need to be on stage.</p><p>And rest assured, you are far better at public speaking than you give yourself credit for. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's symposium was one of the more powerful ones I've hosted. It's only the second one for the 2019 year, and yet the energy of the conversation was alight with inspiration. On the eve of Martin Luther King, Jr's birthday, holiday, this quote made itself recounted:</p><blockquote><p> The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. </p></blockquote><p><cite>Martin Luther King, Jr., paraphrasing Theodore Parker</cite></p><p>There's a lot to go over from today's symposium (and I won't even touch on a large fraction of what we discussed!).</p><h2>Lorenzo's Story</h2><p>The powerful imagery of MLK's paraphrasing come from our discussion about one of the attendee's, Lorenzo Peve (<a href="https://engineeringyourwell-being.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://engineeringyourwell-being.com/</a>) desire to be, as many are wont to do, on a TEDx stage, delivering a speech that will change the world.</p><p>I have seen an initial variant of his speech, and he has the start of a steady foundation from which to deliver his message. It's not concrete yet, though (as no speech in its infancy ever is!) and we spent a lot of time talking about some of the more technical aspects of what he could do make improvements.</p><p>Aristotle's classic modes of persuasion came into play, as they always do in a good technical talk about public speaking. Without going over a lot in details, here are some of the things the forum talked about:</p><h4>Credibility (Ethos)</h4><p>What's the first concern a twenty-two year old has with giving a speech about how to appreciate being mindful of the moment? Age, of course. "Am I credible?" is something we all deal with anytime we step on stage, but the more youthful you are, the less experience you have and the more likely that old, cynical, people will doubt your veracity. And rightfully so. What have you done to prove your worth, after all?</p><p>Turns out you have one of the best proofs of credibility out there: You're human. </p><p>For Lorenzo, he had an emotionally powerful experience not so long ago that involved love and loss of a nature that would (and should) weigh heavily on any human soul. <em>This </em>is his credibility. <em>Experience</em> is his credibility.</p><p>You do not need to have lived a long life to have experienced much that would change your perspective in fundamental ways. Leverage that.</p><h4>Empathy (Pathos)</h4><p>Lorenzo's tale did not lack in empathy. The mournful loss of a loved one. The realization that the future means little if the present is not acknowledged and lived within. "I love you" cannot be told to those whom you do not reach out to, now. </p><h4>Rationale (Logos)</h4><p>Lorenzo's speech is of such a human type that logic, in the strict sense, does not need to be strictly adhered to. His speech is more strongly aligned with the emotional connection. Rather, in this case, the structure of the speech as a whole provides the basis of apparent logic. As long as the structure is consistent in terms of organization and language, the speech will fulfill the needs of Aristotle's Logos and not throw the audience off. Keep this in mind when preparing a speech. Not all logic is created equal, but all minds will fail to grasp your message if you do not provide the "correct" logic.</p><h2>Painting the Well Known To be Original Again</h2><p>We've all binge watched those YouTube and TEDx talks that inspire and enlighten us. We get so much out of that 15 minutes of talk-talk! Or do we?</p><p>We live in an age, and in a culture, where "self-development/improvement" and "world changing" is everywhere. Seems more 75% of non-fiction books are in these broad categories. This is fantastic! Except when it is isn't. </p><p>When is striving to make personal gains not so amazing? When the author or the speaker your spending your precious time engaged with basically repeats the "same old ideas" that you've already watched/read before. These grandiose ideas of improving oneself and of making the world a better place should not be lightly set aside. But the fundamentals of these topics are two, three thousand (arguably more than ten thousand) years old. In our modern age, it can be an honrorable goal to resurrect what was once known and refresh it for a newer audience. But let's not make it boring.</p><p>Lorenzo's speech is on mindfulness of the present and being in the now. Since before the times of Marcus Aurelius and the Buddha, these ideas have been spread. The key to a successful delivery is, ironically enough, to make the the ancient part of the now ‚Äî and the best way to do that is to make the speech resonate with the <em>present audience</em>. This means being intimate. Personal. Passionate. Authentic. Expressive. Tell the story, but tell <em>your</em> story. Make the audience connect with you by painting <em>your</em> experience onto the message that has been repeated a hundred thousand times for the past two thousand years; and in doing so, you make the old (yet powerful), new (and even more powerful).</p><h2>The Moral Arc Redux</h2><p>In the United States, we live in a culture awash with the ideas of self-improvement and that the world can, and should be, made a better place. While we must always temper any overly self-aggrandizing, I'm happy that Lorenzo has the ability and the option to stand up and make yet another speech about what we can do to take the next step towards a better future. </p><p>We still have a long way to go; the future will never be perfect the way "we" <em>think</em> we want it to be, but we can always strive each step to be better, for each word to be better.</p><p>The arc of the moral universe is long, indeed, but justice does not bend on its own. With each speech that is given to guide, with each story that inspires, with each kind word we give each other, the universe bends towards a justice that is truly worthy of ourselves and our descendents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I meet people every week who seem intent on keeping their vocabulary as small and simple as possible. As a public speaking guide, I understand the need for the right word at the right time. Sometimes, the simplest of words can have the greatest impact.</p><p>"I'm sorry for your loss," holds far more empathy in its pure simplicity&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;"I'm sympathetic to the passing of your loved one." Succinctness during times of&nbsp;pain is often the most compassionate thing we can offer.</p><p>Yet, we're holding ourselves back if we keep to using only the most simple of words and grammatical tools.</p><p>Over my numerous years of studying English and other languages and of teaching people to be better public speakers, I'm concerned that to many people are limiting themselves to&nbsp;<em>echoing</em><em>&nbsp;words</em> rather than&nbsp;<em>using the tools of vocabulary</em>.</p><p>"Echoing" is an apt verb for discussing the problem. Just listening to the radio or watching a YouTube video and consider how often the phrases like "really, really" and "very, very" are used. English is a rich, nuanced language, yet we have an incessant habit of using repetition to get our point across.</p><p>Enter&nbsp;<em>vocabulary &amp; grammar&nbsp;</em>as tools to greatly enhance your speaking skills (notice how I didn't write "really, really improve" your speaking skills?).</p><blockquote><p>The difference between the&nbsp;<i>almost right</i>&nbsp;word and the&nbsp;<i>right</i>&nbsp;word is really a large matter. ‚Äôtis the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.</p></blockquote><p><cite>Mark Twain</cite></p><p>As public speakers, we have seemingly innumerable choices of words to present to our audience. Which word will work best in&nbsp;<em>this</em> sentence, in <em>this</em> paragraph, for&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;circumstance?&nbsp;We will we get our point across? Will we "talk over" the level of our audience? Should we "dumb it down?"</p><p>With so many options of words in the English language; with so many cultural idioms, and with having to deal with&nbsp;the seemingly inscrutable&nbsp;grammar that English foists upon on us, it's often just easier to use the smallest set of words, each word with a minimum number of syllables and then simply repeat those words in order to add emphasis.</p><p>It's&nbsp;the difference between</p><p><strong>"It rained really, really hard last night."</strong></p><p>and</p><p><strong>"The rain was torrential last night."</strong></p><p>Which has more power? More impact? Which conveys a better sense of how the weather was the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;night?</p><p>The difference is in&nbsp;<em>vocabulary.</em> The word "torrential" is more concise and more descriptive. A word like torrential lays on a spectrum of words that are useful not only in describing the weather, but a myriad of other situations. On the heavy end of the scale: <em>torrential, relentless, severe</em>. More moderate: <em>heavy, continual, shower</em>. Lighter: <em>sprinkle, misty, drizzle, patter</em>.</p><p>"But," you're thinking, "what if my audience indeed only relates to so-called 'small words'?"</p><p>You're not giving your audience enough credit, then. You're contributing to this small word - small thinking problem by assuming your audience won't understand what you're saying. Give them more credit. Give yourself more credit for being an intelligent, creative, human.&nbsp;Expressing yourself does not mean limiting yourself or not challenging your listeners/readers.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it's&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;true that a conference of scientists will have access to a different vocabulary than that of real estate agents. Each domain of listeners will require you to be considerate, to adapt and be flexible. But there's s difference to customizing your speech to the needs and awareness of the audience, rather than simply "dumbing down" to the lowest common denominator. In dumbing down, you're&nbsp;<em>assuming </em>the nature of those people who&nbsp;occupy&nbsp;the seats before you; who are waiting for you to impart knowledge, entertainment and wisdom, rather than just chatting with them like children (who, in turn, also deserve more credit than they are often given for being thinking, reasoning, beings)</p><p>Regardless if you're a seasoned public speaker on stage, or someone who is taking time to watch the latest TEDx talk on YouTube, I encourage you to speak and listen, both, with greater acceptance for words that might normally be considered "big." Consider new vocabulary&nbsp;words as an opportunity for growth. Find ways to use them in your daily life. Read more literature. Keep a dictionary nearby. Google synonyms and antonyms for those word choices you find you're using too often. Challenge yourself to re-write your speech, your book report, your technical analysis differently -- differently, with new words that enhance the reading or listening experience for your target audience. New phrases, creative idioms, interesting turns of phrase. Contribute to a better, more nuanced, wider ranging, vocabulary.</p><p>For all my defense of the use of more complicated,&nbsp;nuanced and powerful vocabulary, there is one quote I think best sums up how we should use the English language on stage, in writing, and in daily life:</p><blockquote><p>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.</p></blockquote><p><cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p><p>However, music composer Roger sessions re-phrased this comment from Einstein, in a quote that is more often attributed to the grand master of science than the neo-classical composer:</p><blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.</p></blockquote><p><cite>Roger&nbsp;Sessions</cite></p><p>(I think he said it better ‚Äî and more simple ‚Äî than Einstein.)</p><p>Like a hammer or a surgical blade, vocabulary&nbsp;is a tool. Make use of the right tools for the right situation and grow not only your own skills, but also enhance in enlighten the world of those around you. Go out and speak your truth!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grammar and vocabulary are, unexpectedly, crucial to a successful speech. But you can get away with a very limited range of words and still deliver an oration with all the power, fire, and emotional grandeur of an MLK speech ‚Äî or the simple, yet raucous, taboo questioning nature of comedian Sarah Silverman.</p><p>Words are the atoms of the molecules that are sentences. They are the sprinkles on the cake of rhetoric. And other aphorisms. </p><p>When preparing your speech, a few things to consider with regards to words:</p><ol><li>Your audience. Speak to their level ‚Äî but, and this is very important, don't dumb down your language just for the sake of hitting the lowest common denominator. Challenge your audience with your words. On the other hand, don't bludgeon them with words they simply cannot know, nor use words that do not serve them.</li><li>Your own tolerance. Don't try to put in 'big' words for the sake of making your speech sound 'important.' Try new words; keep a thesaurus nearby. But don't force words in where they don't work for you as the speaker.</li><li>Flow. If, during your draft writing (and you are <em>writing</em> out your speech, correct?), you find chunky, too short, too long, or bumpy sentences, take the time to explore how another word might fit better to make the sentence flow. And further on, consider how the flow of the sentences all work together. A single replacement word can make the world of difference to an entire paragraph.</li><li>Repetition. Don't overly-repeat the same word. Unless... you <em>mean </em>to repeat that same word for the sake of emphasis. Even then, look both at the impact of using the same word three times in quick succession compared to three synonyms of a word in quick succession. Maybe words that rhyme would work better, or word that share fluid <dfn title="Words with non-rhyming, similar vowel sounds">assonance</dfn>.</li><li>Impact and Nuance. We're often taught to keep words 'small' ‚Äî small, as in both short length and common in understanding. Yet in English, we have a rich dictionary of words to choose from. Rather than use a word based on simple elements like length or commonality, use the <em>most fitting</em> word for the meaning you intend to convey. "Very big," for example, is far better to be replaced by a word like "massive," or "gargantuan." The latter words have far more impact and imagery compared to "big," "very big," or "really big." </li></ol><p>We haven't even touched on the structure of sentences. Just keeping word choice in mind will often drive the use of grammar. So keep words in mind at all time.</p><p>Words. They make a difference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gun is a potent weapon.</p><p>Imagine walking into a luxuriant office: thick, softly upholstered lounge chairs; a vast sea of hardbound books, well-read and musty with age; and a large, heavy, dark wood desk, replete with a jar of thick Indian ink, a delicate nib-pin, and yellow writing pad. </p><p>And centered upon that writing pad, contrasting highly against the bright yellow sheets and thin blue lines, a <em>gun</em> lies.</p><p>No one walks into a room where a gun is openly visible and does not have concern ripple through their body. No one. </p><p>So why would a speaker present an audience with a gun, yet never use it?</p><p>The gun never need be fired. It never need kill. But if the gun is mentioned, if it is seen, it must have had a purpose to the narrative. For the owner of the gun on the desk ‚Äî there was a reason it lay upon the yellow writing pad.</p><p>This is the posit of Chekhov's Gun. What is seen; what is mentioned; what is observed ‚Äî it must have a point.</p><p>In any given speech, if the speaker makes a comment about an object or activity of significance, it's the responsibility of the speaker to let the audience know <em>why </em>that item is significant.</p><p>Why is there a gun on the desk? Why did the speaker mention that his daughter's birthday dress was torn? Why did the speaker tell us of her uncle's passing?</p><p>To mention something and never bring it backup is to confuse the audience. At best, the speaker has simply wasted words unnecessarily. But usually, they've planted a seed in the audience's mind but never gave it enough water to blossom, and that is a sad state to leave the audience in.</p><p>Chekhov's Gun is a form of foreshadowing. When used with purpose, it builds tension in the narrative that can later be released into the audience. It's creating the ripple of concern in the audience early in the speech, but then soothing that same concern later in the story, releasing the tension and often creating that sought after "ah-ha" moment that really can make an idea or point stick.</p><p>No one thinks of a gun as an insignificant detail.</p><p>Next time you lead <em>your</em> audience through a richly furnished office, watch out for Chekhov's Gun. If you find you've put one into the scene, make sure you put it to use. Your audience will be waiting.</p><hr><p>Links of interest:</p><ul><li>TV Tropes: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun</a></li><li>Now Novel: <a href="https://www.nownovel.com/blog/use-chekhovs-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nownovel.com/blog/use-chekhovs-gun/</a> </li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><dfn>Cognition</dfn> is, per Google: "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses."</p><p>When we are speaking to an audience, it is worth keeping in mind that despite the amazing power of the human brain, it does have limitations when it comes to cognition. Here are some of the "cogs" you should keep in mind both when you are preparing a speech and when you are on the stage.</p><p><strong>The Cogs:</strong></p><dl><dt>Dissonance</dt><dd>The strain of holding two conflicting ideas simultaneously; this usually results in irrational conclusions or behaviors.&nbsp;</dd><dt>Load</dt><dd>The effort a person must exert to take information in as well as commit it to memory. A speaker should always consider the impact of a presentation on the audience's cognitive load and attempt to keep it to a minimum.</dd><dt>Impairment</dt><dd>A condition where a&nbsp;listener&nbsp;is unable to pay attention due to, usually, a physical or mental distraction, such as not having had enough sleep, or perhaps tipping back an extra martini at the lunch break.</dd><dt>Drift</dt><dd>A speaker drifts, or causes drift, when his or her presentation lacks cohesion. Essentially, drifting is having an unfocused or unstructured speech that does not guide the audience or it does allows the audience's attention to wonder. It may also considered leading an audience down a rabbit warren of ideas without appropriate returns or conclusion.</dd><dt>Smoothing</dt><dd>Smoothing is the ability of a speaker to create a aural or&nbsp;visual environment that aligns with the core theme of the speech.</dd><dt>Distortion</dt><dd>The human brain can, and will, lie to itself. A speaker should keep this in mind when preparing a speech, because he or she is subject to it and a speaker's audience equally so.&nbsp;</dd><dt>Tension</dt><dd>The act of&nbsp;deliberately&nbsp;offering&nbsp;polarizing&nbsp;points of view to a listener, or to provide only a one-sided, unanticipated, contrary or antagonistic&nbsp;point of view. Very common in&nbsp;humorous&nbsp;or sexually charged presentations. This must be used in&nbsp;conjunction&nbsp;with Cognitive Release.</dd><dt>Release</dt><dd>Release is the signal for a audience to release any tension that has been built up in their mindset through the previously continual build up of tension. Release is important because it creates safety and a bonding moment between the speaker and the audience. No release leaves an audience&nbsp;disconcerted&nbsp;or unsatisfied.&nbsp;</dd><dt>Leap</dt><dd>Moving from one idea to another without necessarily providing adequate or logical context.&nbsp;</dd></dl><p>Within each of the Cogs, there are more refined considerations a speaker should keep in mind: Are you over-generalizing? Speaking about a complicated topic to a lay audience? Has the audience reached a point of exhaustion? (Prevalent&nbsp;in extended multi-day conferences, for example.) The number of factors that impact how an audience receives your message are as innumerable as there are neurons in our heads. Luckily, us humans do have some level of predictability; the Greeks saw this over two thousand years ago with they&nbsp;codified&nbsp;the modes of rhetoric, giving speakers a common point of view to consider their topic, their audience, and their own personal motivations.</p><p>The best thing to remember is simply this: Your audience&nbsp;are not cogs ‚Äî they're&nbsp;humans and as&nbsp;fallible as you are. So keep your audience's&nbsp;cognitive load in mind (as well as the other cogs) as you step up onto stage!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't take much effort to find examples of truly deplorable leadership in the present (and it's a slam dunk if you take the historical route). Today, I encountered a LinkedIn article and an NPR radio program that centered around the idea of toxic leadership, so it seemed like an obvious choice for a topic, especially considering how many toxic leaders I've encountered in my own career.</p><p>My mother, of all people, use to always say "Screw up, move up." I remember her saying that about politicians when I was a kid and she still says it today. Why is that?</p><p>Part it is what is known as the Peter Principle.</p><p> Dr. Laurence Peter, for whom the principle is named put it this way:</p><blockquote class="inlinequote"><p>In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.</p></blockquote><p>However, that's only part of the problem. Yes, employees rise to fill bigger and bigger positions that they eventually can't handle, but there are two other factors (among many) I'd highlight:</p><ul><li>People don't know how to hire other people.</li><li>Over-confidence in an interview does not competence make.</li></ul><p>On the first point, hiring manager often want someone that is either like them or fulfills some arbitrary standards (from HR, from their own experience, from where ever). I've been involved in the (horrific) practice of group interviews, and I've stood aghast at some of the reasons my fellow interviewers would [not] hire someone. "I was a better coder at his age!" (said an older gentleman), or "I still don't like that he doesn't have a degree" (despite the fact that the candidate demonstrated phenomenal skills in the interview.)</p><p>Hiring managers/teams often forget why they are hiring someone, as well: To fulfill a particular role. But is that role even well defined? I had one boss who insisted I hire someone because he thought my team needed the help. I resisted, because I didn't see a pressing need for anyone in the next several months.</p><p>On the second point, just because someone <em>seems </em>to be well-qualified and has a great personality in the interview doesn't mean he or she is actually competent. In one company, my team met with a recently-hired fellow from another department; he'd been hired as a manager. He had an impressive interview ‚Äî mostly in finance and Wall Street, which set off warning bells in my head, considering that wasn't related to our business domain.</p><p>Turns out, along with the very nice interview skills and well-heeled resume, he had a nasty, nasty temper, and over-engineered certain systems so that using said systems was labyrinthian. Eventually, his team mutinied against him and the company was forced to let him go.</p><p>So what does a hiring manager do? More due diligence, for one. Call the person's past employers (or at least have HR do it!). Set up concrete credentials to be met for the role ‚Äî and I'm not talking "must have 2 years of experience in such-and-such esoteric systems." Rather, codify your department's own culture. What type of person would fit best? Remember, people have different personalities in the work environment than at home. Just because a person is shy and you're group is outgoing, generally, doesn't mean that person won't fit. Consider also, what's <em>tangentially missing</em> from the group and what would be <em>nice to have</em>. </p><p>During the interview sessions, have a consistent set of questions that don't have pre-determined answers (well, mostly not), that way you can compare oranges to oranges. Make sure to ask interested questions, rather than interesting questions ("What do you like to see in management?" vs "What can you do for me?") It helps to through in the biggie questions ‚Äî set up a tough (and hopefully real from the past) scenario and see how they might manage their way through it. </p><p>It takes some fine tuning of other people's tonality, body language and micro-expressions, as well as a bit of experience to hire good folks while remaining relatively unbiased. It takes a lot more work to get rid of those toxic employees (and especially) leaders that you let slip through the cracks just because they were personable in a handful of discussions.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ceos-must-tackle-toxic-senior-leaders-who-damaging-firm-hugh-shields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ceos-must-tackle-toxic-senior-leaders-who-damaging-firm-hugh-shields/</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Fortune Builders' Ignite event at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, I had the pleasure of hearing from Robert O'Neill, the accepted killer of Osama Bin Ladan. A few movies have been made about him and his team, and he wrote a book on the events of the raid: <em>The Operator: Firing the Shots that Killed Osama bin Laden and My Years as a SEAL Team Warrior</em></p>.<p>Having grown up on Air Force , Navy, and Army bases I am very familiar with military culture. I have heard story after story from a variety of military sources ‚Äî the best offer insight into the challenges and threats of their jobs and how teamwork, preparation, and communication make all the difference between success, failure, and possibly death. Most military presenters, however, ramble on about their accomplishments, offering no real takeaways.</p><p>Robert O'Neill is in the former group. His presentation was simultaneously light-hearted, deeply serious, and emotionally touching. I'd like to list the handful of statements I heard from him that I think apply to the rest of us non-military types. Note that not all of these are "unique" to Mr. O'Neill; they were simply blanket statements that any inspirational speaker might say. However, there are a number of gems that come from O'Neill's truly unique perspective, and I'm glad I had a chance to listen.</p><ul><li>"Take the emotion out of the decision"</li><li>Ask: "What's the emotion <em>I'm</em> bringing to the problem?"</li><li>"Don't react; do respond"</li><li>"Do not quit <em>now</em>; that's emotion. Quit tomorrow."</li><li>"We'll talk about this mistake tomorrow" [regarding leaving mistakes behind to focus on immediate needs]</li><li>"Don't assume things are going to go a particular way"</li><li>"Get over it"</li><li>"We need to invent tactics" [regarding that a team must often create new plans on the fly]</li><li>Train, communicate, repeat</li><li>"If they know the <em>why</em> they [the team] will be more effective"</li><li>"Think - push - talk" [regarding radio communication; don't press the talk button until you've thought]</li><li>Complacency and success are inversely related</li><li>Separate decisions and emotions</li><li>"Don't fall in love with your target" [from my perspective, this means you need to accept sunken costs; follow the rules you've established and don't keep after something just because you "love" it]</li><li>"We're [all] actively participating in saving our own lives" [regarding training; more profoundly, individual must keep training and learning and growing so that we move beyond stagnation and suffering]</li><li>"The enemy is all your doubts [and] all your fears"</li></ul><p>My favorite, however, as it pertains to public speaking is this comment he made:</p><blockquote><p>When you're done saying what you're saying, stop</p></blockquote><p><cite>Robert O'Neill</cite></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I ponder the possibility of writing a book on public speaking and the social value of rhetoric in human society, my mind wandered over to the animal kingdom as a whole.</p><p>Do animals engage in rhetoric? What are the implications of that in terms of animals studies? We're prone, as humans, to anthropomorphize every critter out there. What can we learn from this contrast? (heads up, I'm not even going to try and answer this question... sorry to disappoint, but it's a MASSIVE topic to delve into, but I will talk a little about Koko the gorilla and her kittens.</p><p>In this quick read with cute pictures (<a href="https://www.koko.org/koko%27s-kittens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.koko.org/koko%27s-kittens</a>) at the Gorilla Foundation, the author mentions how Koko "convinced" the caretakers to let her have a kitten. They eventually acquiesced and over the decades, Koko was the proud parent of several kittens (gorillas are long lived like we are, so they outlive many animals the same way we do). </p><p>That opens up the semantical question of, "Is 'convincing' the same as 'persuading'?" With enough persistence, a child can convince their mother to buy them a toy by emotional wearing them down. Is this what Koko did? In this particular case, I'm going to presume that the caretakers were more interested in the research implications of how a gorilla and a cat might live together, giving them greater insight into gorilla psychology. Gorillas and chimps are our closest genetic relatives, so we could learn a lot about ourselves as well.</p><p>And in comparison, maybe we could learn about our own psychology when it comes to persuading each other.</p><hr><p>Links:</p><ul><li>The workshop page that got me thinking about this: https://www.indiana.edu/~iucweb/rsa17/workshops/animal-rhetorics/</li><li>Zootopia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zootopia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zootopia</a></li><li>Lion King: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's a common activity I see on stage that I feel needs to be addressed and nipped off at the ankles.</p><p>I call it "The Pace."</p><p>This is that habit that many ‚Äî arguably&nbsp;<em>most</em> ‚Äî&nbsp; speakers have of pacing back and forth across the stage. Many folks, such as executives, coaches, and sales people can deliver a sense of&nbsp;authority and magnitude even as they pace. It seems like there's nothing really wrong with this, right? As long as the rest of the delivery works?</p><p>Sadly, there's quite a bit wrong with "The Pace." There are three points in particular worth expositing:</p><ol><li>The Pace is done out of habit, nervousness, or worse, it comes from a misguided sense that "prowling" the stage like an animal makes the speaker seem more powerful. (Really, a pacing animal is often distressed or getting ready to pounce on its prey; neither vibe is attractive to an audience.)</li><li>The Pace distracts the audience. The constant moving back and forth can quickly become monotonous, draining the audience's cognitive reserves and lowering their attention span. It may even cause some anxiety, if the movement is too frenetic; especially relative to the context or tone of the speech itself.</li><li>The Pace is serves no contextual purpose, nor is it a&nbsp;style component of the speech. It does not support the&nbsp;structure of the speech, or does it aid in memorizing the speech topic. The Pace is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>done done with any deliberation.</li></ol><p>On stage "The Pace", if executed with confidence, can look quite impressive. However, because it is external to the speech and an often habituated action, it doesn't&nbsp;contribute to the audience's attention; rather it detracts. A key aphorism&nbsp;in creating a solid speech is "Waste not, want not." Consider that speaker's words and audience's attention are both precious commodities. Don't waste the audience's mental time with extravagant&nbsp;extras, such as "The Pace." Save the extravagance for another time, another place.</p><p>The speech itself should be the the locus of attention for the audience. Not the speaker's ankles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ancient Greeks came up with&nbsp;a framework to define how speeches are to be written, consisting of five canons: Inventio, Disposito, Elocutio, Memoria, Actio.</p><ul><li>"<strong>Inventio</strong>" ‚Äî Thoughts, development, research and other less tangible ideas that form the seed of a speech. Even pre-writing is included here.</li><li>"<strong>Disposito</strong>" ‚Äî The structure of a speech, in terms of how it is written out and where various elements such as body language or vocal variety will be used.</li><li>"<strong>Elocutio</strong>" ‚Äî This is the inherent style of the speech that the speaker will use for delivery. Is it a serious speech? Playful? What body language supports the theme?</li><li>"<strong>Memoria</strong>" ‚Äî More than just memorization, this about external factors that can help support the delivery of the speech. The gathering of quotes that might be useful within the speech, but then only a single pick is actually used in the speech; and the specific quote is changed&nbsp;depending&nbsp;on the audience.</li><li>"<strong>Actio</strong>" ‚Äî This is the act of delivering the speech itself, body language, vocal variety, tone, stage movement, eye contact and so on. All should be planned in the preceding canons so that the speaker is ready for this delivery.</li></ul><p>The canons are more than just an outline to run through when writing speech; they are more a way of thinking. Four out of five of the canons are all preparation, and some, like Inventio and Memoria should be continually on a speaker's mind even when he or she isn't actively working on a specific speech. They could be considered "living the life" of a speech writer; anything in the external world, away from the stage, should be looked at with a critical eye (and ear) as a way to aid in the big speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memorization is a tricky topic to manage. To memorize a speech rote is to risk a robotic or mechanical delivery. Every speech is influenced by the environment it is presented in and if the speech doesn't have enough flexibility built in, it can't be&nbsp;adapted&nbsp;as well to the needs of the audience, nor even the speaker themselves.</p><p>This is where structure comes into play.</p><p>A well structured speech allows for&nbsp;<em>more,&nbsp;</em>not less, flexibility. It is within the confines of a well understood&nbsp;framework that a speaker can add extemporaneous flair or change up the tone of the speech on the fly. The structure sets predefined waypoints along the speech; it becomes a map for the speech. It's easier to memorize the frame of the speech than the speech itself.</p><p>With persistent&nbsp;rehearsal&nbsp;(not necessarily memorization), the speak should seek to embed the framework of the speech into their mind. This is distinctly different than writing an outline. An outline is simply a to-do list of sorts, as in "First, I need to hit this point; then I need to move to that point" and so on. An outline is not supported by the environment of the speech in the moment, nor that of the speech writing process. It simply does not have enough support structure to it.</p><p>One good example of a lightweight structural component to consider is "Start with the end in mind." This is a classic thought process to use when constructing a speech. At the surface, you want the conclusion of the speech to tie in with the introduction. The paragraphs in turn are all put into place to enforce that connection, so that when the speech ends, the start and finish are pulled together to form a tight, understandable, and memorable package, both for the speaker and for the audience.</p><p>"Start with the end in mind" is fractal in nature ‚Äî it applies equally well to paragraphs. The first sentence of paragraph two should be related the last sentence of paragraph one, which in turn should be connected to the title, theme, and style of the speech.</p><p>Along with structure, body language, stage movement, and even vocal variety can be intertwined&nbsp;purposely&nbsp;within a speech to help a speaker physically memorize a speech, not just mentally.</p><p>Structure: it's not just for buildings anymore.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public speaking is a holistic discipline. Over time, a practitioner will see how all the parts connect together seamlessly. What's nice about the learning process is that so much of public speaking can be broken into discrete components, for instance, body motion and vocal variety as two separate areas of practice.</p><p>Vocal variety and body movement have a pretty&nbsp;intuitive connection to each other; they are easy to align and deliver to the audience. But what about structure? Does it play a part in vocal variety?</p><p>Absolutely. When writing a speech, consider vocal variety as a way to solidify a point. In isolation, the change in tone or pitch may not make sense, but if it is well-placed in the context of the rest of the speech, then the vocal expression takes on more significance.</p><p>One idea when writing out the speech is to think of how it will be said out loud. Is it&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;with the last expression? The next expression? Vocal variety can also be used to signal the speaker that a new phrase is coming up, aiding in memorization of the speech as well.</p><p>There's more to be said! And say it again in upcoming speaking symposiums we will. See you at the next one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've recently watched a number of YouTube videos where first quarter of the talk was wrapped up in overly wrought introductions. The topics of these videos tended around informational subjects and the hosts wanted to establish their credibility, as well as promote the video (a very common thing on YouTube).</p><p>Long intros like these are a drag. Set aside your ego or your fears of "looking qualified" long enough to get your basic points across.</p><p>In these short format informational talks, I'd recommend that the intro be kept short and sweet. Do two things:</p><ol><li>Put out a simplified version of your credentials. Yes, you might be a doctor with a lot of letters after your name, and board certified this and that, but most audience will take your most basic information at face value. If you claim to be an expert, great! Just make the claim and at most mention that you've done a lot of research in the field you are about to talk about.</li><li>Then introduce your audience&nbsp;to the field. Your expertise will quickly show up in the 30 seconds to a minute that you are describing the topic. Any more than that, and it might be construed by the audience that maybe, just maybe, you don't know what you're talking about.</li></ol><p>It's not that you&nbsp;<em>don't</em> know what your talking about. It's more that your rambling and you've&nbsp;put to much cognitive load onto your audience. They've drifted and if the intro goes to long, or the main content doesn't back up their expectations from your intro, you've failed in delivering your message.</p><p>Keep it short. Let other parts of the environment, like a presentation slide, the doobley-doo under the video, or the host of the&nbsp;conference provide the extra information to amplify your credibility. The irony is, the more credentials&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>you</em> personally throw out, the less credible you look -- and more boring as well. So keep information intros simple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Credibility</strong> is the character or the perception of authority, credibility or experience of the speaker. It is called <em>Ethos</em> by the ancient Greeks.</p><p>Examples of Credibility from famous speeches:</p><blockquote><p>"I‚Äôm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn‚Äôt been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don‚Äôt lose faith. I‚Äôm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You‚Äôve got to find what you love. "</p></blockquote><p><br><em>Steve Jobs, Stanford University, 2005</em></p><blockquote><p>"Here's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions."</p></blockquote><p><br><em>Aimee Mullins, TEDMED 2009</em></p><p>In these speeches, we garner a sense that the speakers have the experience that gives them the weight to speak as figures of authority. The audience does not doubt the veractiy of their claims, and accepts these claims, mostly, at face value.</p><p>Jobs uses the phrase "awful tasting medicine" to invoke the idea that he's been through something potent, and that it has given him great experience (in living a good life). He's saying, "Look at how my life went, and it still turned out well&nbsp;because I&nbsp;pursued&nbsp;what I loved." He offers the moral authority to give the audience direction in their lives. And that these comments are coming from a man whose background is well known&nbsp;further cements his call to action.</p><p>Mullins offers an even more concrete from of Credibility; as an amputee she has had experiences that few of us could rightly imagine. As she tells her story, re-defining the notion of "disabled," she is able to offer more gravitas and weight. No audience would take&nbsp;seriously a man with all of his limbs giving he same speech (and likely, this hypothetical speaker wouldn't be able to take himself seriously).</p><p>It is in delivering a speech with&nbsp;Credibility&nbsp;that the speaker reassures the audience that the message being delivered is backed by experience, the that person on stage has some education that proves their statements can be taken as truth. And to be clear, the mode of Credibility does not necessarily have to be delivered from a personal perspective. Quoting someone well known and respected can also offer up a indirect form of Credibility. Same with citing a scientific paper or referring to the ideals of a well know and accepted authority on the topic. In either case, directly or indirectly, Credibility relies on the orator presenting his or her speech with genuine authenticity and the best intentions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Empathy</strong> is the emotional connection a speaker makes with the audience. The ancient Greeks called it&nbsp;<em>Pathos</em>.</p><p>Examples of Empathy from famous speeches:</p><blockquote><p>"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'"</p></blockquote><p><br><em>Martin Luther King, Jr., Lincoln Memorial, 196</em>3</p><blockquote><p>"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."</p></blockquote><p><br><em>John F. Kennedy, Jr., Rice Stadium, 1961</em></p><p>In both of these powerful orations, the speaker taps into the deeper emotional sensibilities of the audience.</p><p>King uses the fundamental founding ideals of the United States as a way to stir in a mixture of&nbsp;patriotism and sympathy. While his immediate audience in front of him was mostly black with a smattering of white supporters, his larger audience was that of the rest of the nation. His intent was to remind us of our inherited vows as US citizens. That "all men are created equal". All&nbsp;men. Not&nbsp;some&nbsp;men, but&nbsp;all&nbsp;men.</p><p>And Kennedy, during the Cold War and with an effort to rally the nation to support a peaceful scientific endeavor, moves his audience with several passionate sparks. He reminds us, US Americans, that we don't shirk away from hard work, that we are at our best when the challenges are great, and we all also have the abilities to take on this monumental task. He is, in a sense, acknowledging what most of us perceive as our inherent nature, and offering a challenge to that nature, something no "true hard-working American" would not back down from.</p><p>Our emotions are our most primary of motivators. Even in our most logical moments, surrounded by all data, a tiny sliver of emotion haunts our choices. The powerful orator recognizes this little fact and leverages it to inspire people to action, or to offer a tender story, or to generate raucous laughter. It is in having an empathic connection to the audience that a speaker can do this well and consistently draw the audience into their story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Reason</strong> is the form of logic and rationality or evidence offered to the audience. <em>Logos</em> is Aristotle's word, the root of the word 'logic.'</p><p>Examples of Reason from famous speeches:</p><blockquote><p>"Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand."</p></blockquote><p><br><em>Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994</em></p><blockquote><p>"You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all ‚Äì in which case, you fail by default."</p></blockquote><p><br><em>J.K. Rowlings, Harvard University, 2011</em></p><p>Sagan gets straight to the heart of the matter in this portion of his narration of the Pale Blue Dot. There is no evidence of other life; no where we could escape a truly global catastrophe. His statements are completely rational; indeed, we have no ability even a quarter of a century later to settle other extraterrestrial locales. We're stuck here.</p><p>This part of Rowlings' graduation speech at Harvard starts with Credibility, regarding the well known troubles of her past. She follows with Reason: "it is impossible to live without failing," something few people could reasonably disagree with. Likewise, she probes deeper, asking indirectly for the audience to consider how risk-averse they may be; and then she tells them the&nbsp;consequences for being too cautiously.</p><p>Reason backs up all that Empathy and&nbsp;Credibility&nbsp;set up. The speech itself must be rationally organized, letting the audience keep track of what is happening. and statements of apparent truth cannot simply be presented without some sort of reason. No matter the background of a speaker, telling the audience that the sky is green simply will not sit well, and cause consternation in the audience. Having a rambling story line with no apparent connection between paragraphs will also lose the audience. Keep Reason in mind with each sentence written. Does it properly and rationally connect with the other parts of the speech? If it is not truly true, then it must be eliminated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you are standing in front of an audience, think about your feet.</p><p>Yes, your feet.</p><p>Whenever you forget about your feet, your legs and your arms, they will start to speak for you. And sometimes they will say some weird things.</p><p>Some of the things they will say will include:</p><p><em>I forgot what I was going to say.</em></p><p><em>I'm nervous.</em></p><p><em>What am I going to say now?</em></p><p><em>I forgot to pee!</em></p><p>Just as often, they won't say anything, but start to move out of habit. If you find your feet are randomly roaming around the stage, stop. Lookup and orient yourself with your audience. Make eye contact. If your arms seem to be using the same repetitive gesture time and time again, take control. Exaggerate a specific gesture. Open your arms as wide as possible to describe a large object; or pinch your fingers together and squint your eyes to look through the tiny gap to show a small item.</p><p>Speaking of eyes, they too will speak for you. If you stare off into the background, or keep looking at the ground, you may give your audience of being disconnected from them. Look at them. They're humans and need your attention. Give it to them.</p><p>Then double check that your feet are where you want them to be, and not moving to somewhere else.</p>]]></content:encoded>
