Every time we put a label on a concept, and idea, or a system with the best of intentions to describe it and that system or idea becomes popular, that label (and by extension the system itself) gets corrupted into a mockery of itself.

Without fail.

Every. 👏 Single. 👏 Time.

Why? Because we're human with our own individual needs and drives, living in our own unique cultures and social structures, and all human languages are fallible and open to interpretation. No single label or categorization can withstand that degree of entropy.

So what do we need to do? Be open minded, want the best for others, and keep communicating. It's the only tool we have to fight corporate jargon and buzzwords, misleading advertisements, propaganda, and worst of all, our own internal biases.
