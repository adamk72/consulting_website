<p>When I was a kid, I was terminally shy. The concept of eye contact was as terrifying as jumping off a bridge. The sensation of the hair raising on my back each time I'd even glance someone's way was a clear sign of being in a flight response. If I didn't know you, I probably barely would look you in the eye.</p>
<p>Thankfully, partly through the miracle of puberty and then practice through college, I had far less trouble making eye contact with folks; came to understand the cultural norms regarding it as well, just so I didn't overshoot any tender boundaries.</p>
<p>What I've noticed over the years in networking and business meetings is almost an inverse problem that I had â€” people are <em>too</em> focused on eye contact. Not in a creepy way, but in an exclusitory way. </p>

<p>When your engaged in a circle of folks at a networking event or around a table in a meeting room, make sure that you engage with <em>everyone. </em>If you're speaking, look not only at the main target of your comments, but also glance around at the other folks, giving them at least a micro-second of empathic connection with your eyes. What I often observe is that the speaker of the moment cannot take their eyes off one person, almost forgetting other people are around them.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by eye contact being used in a exclusionary way. Instead, by at least scanning the other observers you become inclusionary. The benefits are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can see the state of your listeners; are you boring them? Exciting them? Their micro-expressions will tell you legions.</li>
<li>You give yourself a bit of break from staring at the same person; likewise, you give the person your staring at a break and an reason for them too to look at the other folks.</li>
<li>When you return to your main focus, you can given them the opportunity to respond back. Glancing around is a great "pre-check" that your point has been made, and then you are handing over the baton for another person to take.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's inclusion through eye contact. So watch yourself next time you're in a meeting. Keep a conscious tally of how often you look around at the other folks in the space. Let them feel involved. Even if they are a shy as I was as a kid, and don't say anything at all, they'll be glad when your give them a friendly look.</p>
