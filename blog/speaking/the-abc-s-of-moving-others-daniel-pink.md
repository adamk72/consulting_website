<p>In Daniel Pink's book, <em>To Sell is Human </em>(Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Moving-Others-ebook/dp/B0087GJ8KM">https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Moving-Others-ebook/dp/B0087GJ8KM</a>), he writes about the ABC's of moving people; that is, how to persuade and sell to other folks. His ABC's are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: Attunement - Getting aligned with another's perspective.</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: Buoyancy - Handling rejection.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: Clarity - Making sense of the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Pink's ABC's are worth adding as tools to the public speaking arena. Aside from the obvious connection between "selling" and being on stage persuading, these ideas fill in some spaces that the three modes, Credibility, Empathy, and Reason miss out on. </p>
<p>Attunement and Empathy are practically synonyms; still, as a speaker, one must remember to keep aligned with audience, so Attunement is a powerful reminders. Buoyancy reminds us that even on stage, there's a remote chance of rejection by the audience; what form that takes will vary. The important point is that if a speaker was somehow disconnected from the shared reality of the audience, the speaker shouldn't take it personal. Rather, the speaker should <em>learn</em> from such events, and improve on the next performance. And lastly, Clarity: this one applies to so many levels of public speaking: during research, figuring out how to distill the core message; during delivery, making sure to present the evidence or ideas in a reasonable way; and even after a speech, getting clear feedback on how the speech went. All important elements for growth.</p>
