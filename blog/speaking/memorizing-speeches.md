<p>Memorization is a tricky topic to manage. To memorize a speech rote is to risk a robotic or mechanical delivery. Every speech is influenced by the environment it is presented in and if the speech doesn't have enough flexibility built in, it can't be adapted as well to the needs of the audience, nor even the speaker themselves.</p>
<p>This is where structure comes into play.</p>

<!--truncate-->

<p>A well structured speech allows for <em>more, </em>not less, flexibility. It is within the confines of a well understood framework that a speaker can add extemporaneous flair or change up the tone of the speech on the fly. The structure sets predefined waypoints along the speech; it becomes a map for the speech. It's easier to memorize the frame of the speech than the speech itself.</p>
<p>With persistent rehearsal (not necessarily memorization), the speak should seek to embed the framework of the speech into their mind. This is distinctly different than writing an outline. An outline is simply a to-do list of sorts, as in "First, I need to hit this point; then I need to move to that point" and so on. An outline is not supported by the environment of the speech in the moment, nor that of the speech writing process. It simply does not have enough support structure to it.</p>
<p>One good example of a lightweight structural component to consider is "Start with the end in mind." This is a classic thought process to use when constructing a speech. At the surface, you want the conclusion of the speech to tie in with the introduction. The paragraphs in turn are all put into place to enforce that connection, so that when the speech ends, the start and finish are pulled together to form a tight, understandable, and memorable package, both for the speaker and for the audience.</p>
<p>"Start with the end in mind" is fractal in nature &mdash; it applies equally well to paragraphs. The first sentence of paragraph two should be related the last sentence of paragraph one, which in turn should be connected to the title, theme, and style of the speech.</p>
<p>Along with structure, body language, stage movement, and even vocal variety can be intertwined purposely within a speech to help a speaker physically memorize a speech, not just mentally.</p>
<p>Structure: it's not just for buildings anymore. </p>
