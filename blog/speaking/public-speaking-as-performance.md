<p>We <em>all</em> get nervous when we get on stage. As Mark Twain put it:</p>
<blockquote class="inlinequote">
<p>There are two types of speakers: Those who get nervous and those who are liars.</p>

<p><cite>—Mark Twain (attributed)</cite></p>
<p>But some folks — okay, <em>most </em>folks — get it in their head that they have to provide a pitch perfect performance. This expectation causes even deeper anxiety and in turn, the butterflies take on monstrous proportions. It doesn't need to be that way.</p>

<p>The problem, as I see it, is in the word "performance." For those of us, myself included, who aren't trained in the classical arts, performing can seem unnatural and downright intimidating. On top of that, we often get the feeling we're being disingenuous. After all, isn't performing taking on the guise of someone else?</p>
<p>Not at all! We perform every day. Consider how you act (see that word?!) in front of say, your mother, as opposed to your boss. Social conventions require us to adapt our own internal thermostats to deal with the current social circumstances. Old college buddies? Curse like a sailor. Meeting your significant other's parents? Less cursing, more politeness.</p>
<p>Regardless, you're <em>always</em> performing. It's just that being on stage means your performing for lots of folks; this does not diminish the fact that it is a different social situation that you need to adapt to. So adapt away!</p>
<p>Performance is not the same as theatrical acting. Performance in public speaking is the act of being deliberate and concentrated in your delivery in such a way that it fits the needs and expectations of your audience. Keep that in mind and maybe the roar of the butterflies will calm down. Best of luck!</p>
