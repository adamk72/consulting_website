<p>No, it's not Godzilla's next major foe.</p>
<p>Chiasmus is where the second part of a sentence mirrors the first part, but in reverse. The one I like to use to remind myself to keep things humble is:</p>
<blockquote class="inlinequote">
<p>Take pride, but don't let pride take you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is a more famous one most US Americans are familiar with...</p>

<blockquote class="inlinequote">
<p>Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>â€” John F. Kennedy, Jr.</cite></p>
<p>Chiasmus is a useful way to provide emphasis to your point. By providing your audience with this mirroring of concepts, you activate their deeper cognitive processes; yet, it is a figure of speech not so unfamiliar or esoteric to the human brain that your audience won't be able to easily unwind it. Done well, it's a clever mechanism for engaging your audience, plus it adds a poetic flair to your speech.</p>
<p>Speaking of poetic, from the Google definition of chiasmus:</p>
<blockquote class="inlinequote">
<p>Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds.</p>
</blockquote>
