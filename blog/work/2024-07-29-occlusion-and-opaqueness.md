There are three major problems with the world. More, actually, but as far as I'm concerned at a personal level, these are the ones that bother me the most:

<!-- truncate -->

1. Population

Simply put, we long ago hit a point in our population growth that there are simply too many of us to properly educate in the ways of the world. When populations used to be more isolated (not even as far back as the 20th century) there were opportunities to use a combination of both the culture and higher education (not necessarily colleges) to teach people to actually think for themselves and more importantly, the number of "poor" outliers was as far smaller percentage of the population.

What do I mean? There are too types of outliers in a population: Those who rebel against norms because they see and can articulate the problems of those norms and then those who simply don't know what the norms are, either by ignorance or by deviance. You want the first in your population. In my mind, you should encourage it. The second are people who, either because the culture failed them or because they are just, for lack of a better word, that stupid, don't properly interact with the rest of a culture. 

In previous eras, these sorts of people were caught early and, uh-hm... "re-educated." Parents taught their children to be better. But as we've gotten more populous, more people slip through the cracks. This is how you get stupid people that think that posing with a moose is a good idea and get upset when the moose nearly kills them. They're dumb.

Yes, you can blame the Internet, but I think it's not the Internet that causes the problems, I think it amplifies the voices of those already stupid people. In a way, the internet + a large population = bad times.

And it's not a globalization thing either. People of any reasonable culture (I'm not counting cultures made up of people who want everyone in the world to burn except who they choose), knows within a few degrees that defiling ancient buildings just for kicks is not a good idea. You wouldn't want it done in your country, why do it another country?

Too many people slipping through the cracks. There are too many bad actors who don't consider the consequences of their actions, very often because they literally don't know any better (or they convinced themselves that they don't). I'm thinking about the gulf between men and women now, which has always been there before, but social norms, for better or worse, railroaded most of Western society into path; if you were clear on how you wanted to be different [say, being gay when most people around you are straight], then at least you could make the choice [let me clarify what I mean later], but for the rest of us schleps, we need someone or something to point us in _a_ direction. I think this is way Evangelicalism and Republicanism is so prevalent today; it takes the thinking away.

And I think, for those of us who are clueless, this is good. But what is bad is when we _choose_ to stay clueless and doubly worse is when the systems don't allow us to deviate from them (or triply worse, when those systems make every attempt to make other systems very, very wrong).


2. Attention

3. Opaqueness

The other big problem is just opaqueness. I blame lobbyists and negligent capitalism on this. There's too much information, yes, but on top of that, companies use that as a shield, sometimes actively, to hide prices and behaviors from normal consumers. I get that supply and demand market forces come into play, but life would be a better user experience in general if we got a heads up on the risks we're getting into sometimes.
