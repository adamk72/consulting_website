"Over-communication" is not a thing because things change and there is always a reason to communicate.

What people often get bogged down in is _what_ to communicate and _when_, for fear of inducing communication fatigue (assuming they have an honest intent to actually communicate). 

The key word is *communicating*.

- ðŸ‘‰ If the message you send one day isn't much different from the day before, you're rambling, not communicating.
- ðŸ‘‰ If your message isn't relevant and contextualized, you're talking to yourself, not communicating.
- ðŸ‘‰ If your message is there to induce excitement or fear without following up with action, you're crying wolf, not communicating.
- ðŸ‘‰ If your messaging is inconsistent, you're confusing people, not communicating.

You can over-talk. You can over-share. You can over-message. You _can't_ over-communicate.
