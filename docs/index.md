:::tip
If you're here to learn quickly or because you have ADHD as bad as mine, **feel free to skip** most of the fluff writing, like below. The **juicy parts** are in the `code blocks`, callouts like this one, and sometimes in the quotation blocks. The rest is just written as way to get my head clear and probably can be ignored.

:::warning
I'll hit on most topics in Haskell eventually (as I learn them and as makes sense to me), but not in the order of most typical programming courses/lessons.

I will also assume you know the basics of programming and are familiar with tools like REPLs and high-level concepts like "types" and "classes."

## Welcome
Hello! This is my attempt to organize my thoughts on Haskell as I learn it. The world of Haskell is... _disparate_ to say the least. For a language that has been around for as long as it has, documentation is often (in my mind) inconsistent, incomplete, or downright opaque.

Part of that is, I'm sure, that while I'm no stranger to functional programming, Haskell is abyssal to the degree at which it approaches the topic. It is deeply rooted in academia and was named after [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry), a renowned mathematician and logician who died eight years before the language came out in 1990. The last major release of Haskell was July of 2010, fourteen years ago.

Contrary to belief, as far as my research goes, Haskell is far from a dead language though. The likes of Facebook and Google have dabbled in it and I'm aware of several modern, well-funded companies who use the language as their principal backend development choice. For me, it's an exercise in getting away from procedural programming; I'm trading the chaotic world of way-too-many JavaScript platforms for the almost alchemical space of Haskell.

All that said, there's a lot to dive into.

## A Procedural Perspective

My background was originally in C/C++, Java, and Objective-C. I later turned to JavaScript/TypeScript and HTMl/CSS, and have dabbled quite a bit in Rust and Go. That is to say, I'm steeped in the procedural &mdash; but... I almost always have tried to leverage functional coding when it was available, like in JS and Rust.



## Alternative Resources
So far, these two sources have been my favorite for learning Haskell and I return to them on a regular basis:
- [Haskell MOOC](https://haskell.mooc.fi/) &mdash; Short online course from the University of Helsinki
- [Well-Typed Intro to Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3blAsQDT0u8&list=PLD8gywOEY4HauPWPfH0pJPIYUWqi0Gg10) &mdash; YouTube video series by Andres LÃ¶h
