## Welcome
Hello! This is my attempt to organize my thoughts on Haskell as I learn it. The world of Haskell is... _disparate_ to say the least. For a language that has been around for as long as it has, documentation is often (in my mind) inconsistent, incomplete, or downright opaque.

Part of that is, I'm sure, that while I'm no stranger to functional programming, Haskell is abyssal to the degree at which it approaches the topic. It is deeply rooted in academia and was named after [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry), a renowned mathematician and logician who died eight years before the language came out in 1990. The last major release of Haskell was July of 2010, fourteen years ago.

Contrary to belief, as far as my research goes, Haskell is far from a dead language though. The likes of Facebook and Google have dabbled in it and I'm aware of several modern, well-funded companies who use the language as their principal backend development choice. For me, it's an exercise in getting away from procedural programming; I'm trading the chaotic world of way-too-many JavaScript platforms for the almost alchemical space of Haskell.

All that said, there's a lot to dive into.

The "logic" of the following sections is what works for me. Feel free to reach out to me with corrections or clarifications, and keep in mind that at the time you're reading this, it's probably still very much a work in progress.

## Alternative Resources
So far, these two sources have been my favorite for learning Haskell and I return to them on a regular basis:
- [Haskell MOOC](https://haskell.mooc.fi/) &mdash; Short online course from the University of Helsinki
- [Well-Typed Intro to Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3blAsQDT0u8&list=PLD8gywOEY4HauPWPfH0pJPIYUWqi0Gg10) &mdash; YouTube video series by Andres LÃ¶h
