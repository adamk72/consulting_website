# Adam Kecskes &mdash; Engineering and Operations Management
I see myself as a force multiplier, excelling in bringing the best in teams and hiring the best as needed. Over the past 25 years, I have developed a series of life-tested heuristics for leading technical projects of any complexity.

My approach to development and management is about professionalizing the fun and challenging parts of software engineering while anticipating and avoiding or removing the dark patterns and obstacles that hinder the success of my teams, our customers, and the organization.

I‚Äôm focused on recognizing and dignifying the needs of clients and contributors alike while sparking a sense of curiosity through holistic and lateral thinking. I favor well-proven patterns and practices and the creation of code and systems that are robust, adaptable, and configurable for both internal and client/customer needs.

I have three creeds that drive my vision of a successful team, project, or company:

1. We don't blame, we solve _(and when we solve, we do it at the root level)_.
2. The customer will always change their mind at the last minute, so plan for it.
3. Communication and collaboration are ongoing ‚Äî _and very much human_ ‚Äî activities.
