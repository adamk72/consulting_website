# Adam Kecskes &mdash; Engineering and Operations Management
I see myself as a force multiplier, excelling in bringing out the best in teams and hiring the best as needed. Over the past 25 years, I have developed a series of real-life tested heuristics for leading technical projects of any complexity. I‚Äôm focused on recognizing and dignifying the needs of clients and contributors alike while sparking a sense of curiosity through collaborative conversation and holistic and lateral thinking.

My management approach is about eliminating unnecessary processes, automating the boring parts, and engaging the challenging parts of development head-on while anticipating, avoiding, and removing the dark patterns and obstacles that hinder the success of my teams, our customers, and the organization. Very much willing to travel as needed.

In development, I favor well-proven patterns and practices and the creation of code and systems that are robust, adaptable, and configurable for both internal and client/customer needs.

I have three creeds that drive my vision of a successful team, project, or company:

1. We don't blame, we solve _(and when we solve, we do it at the root level)_.
2. The customer will always change their mind at the last minute, so plan for it.
3. Communication and collaboration are ongoing ‚Äî _and very much human_ ‚Äî activities.
