# Adam Kecskes
It's a messy world out there and a lot gets lost in the effort to "make things better." Regardless of what role I've ever been hired for, I always had a predilection towards organizing, optimizing, and seeking precision.

The effort I put in for a company distinctly gives them huge advantage in terms of getting work done correctly and consistently. This can range from the mundane things like fewer misspellings and more clear processes and documentation, fewer bugs, higher quality output, and actionable metrics all the way to more well defined and useful products and overall smarter, more sophisticated, and more self-aware employees.

I amplify and magnify the positive aspects of a company, bringing awareness and helping them grow into their full potential.

_For most companies, the title noted is the last title I held with that company._
