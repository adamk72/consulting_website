                Is your company floundering or flourishing? How can you even tell? (hint: your team spends more time in meetings and on emails than on being creative and collaborative.) I will examine you and your teams' processes, styles, and values so you can develop the clarity and confidence to take on bigger goals.

                As your team and company grows, there can be a loss of community and communication, especially if the leadership is pulled in a thousand different directions. I help leaders focus on their strengths and teach teams how to take on delegated tasks while still being effective with their work. It's all about making the right shifts in both systems and culture.

                All too often companies get lost in their own systems. Many don't realize how many steps could be automated or outright ignored, freeing up valuable cognitive space and reducing cortisol levels so they can be better connected. I help you find and correct the gaps in your processes so you can be more effective and less stressed.
