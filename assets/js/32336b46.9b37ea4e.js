Most good software companies put considerable thought into their pricing structure (though I'll admit, I've seen my fair share of willy-nilly pricing for features \u2014 a rule of thumb, if they don't advertise their pricing on the web or at least give you an easy way to get a price range with a quick call or email... they just might be bamboozling you.
